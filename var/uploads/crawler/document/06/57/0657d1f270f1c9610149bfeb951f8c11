<h1>Welcome to w3track.com</h1>

<h2>Who are we?</h2><br>
We are a small distributed team of developers with the goal of building a stable lightweight tracking system for internet sales. We contribute to the project as our time allows; none of us are designers and we know this frontpage is "butt-ugly". 
<br><Br>
<h2>What is w3track?</h2><br>
W3track is webbased 3rd party affiliate tracking software that follows industry best-practices in collecting, monitoring, and protecting data.<br>
Data is the sole property of the client-- W3track does not build customer profiles to market to, nor do we repurpose it in any way. W3track does not send email, run campaigns, call people, talk to them on the street, or do any other kind of marketing. If you are unhappy about a marketing issue,  please take it up with the owner of the site you were landed on.<br><Br>
