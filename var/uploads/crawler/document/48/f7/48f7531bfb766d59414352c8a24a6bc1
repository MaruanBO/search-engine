Thanks for setting up a cname to point to your affiliate software.  It usually takes 24 hours before your cname is working properly and this page will disappear and your affiliate software will come up.  If after 24 hours you still do not see your affiliate software come up at this link then open a <b><a href = http://www.omnistaretools.com/download></b> support ticket </a> and technical support  will make sure everything is fixed.
