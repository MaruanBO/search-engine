Store visits, ostensibly intended as intelligence-gathering missions, were meticulously planned affairs, only slightly less formal than, say, a presidential visit. Every relevant national manager and local functionary would be notified in advance, each step choreographed, the \u201cregular shoppers\u201d handpicked and vetted. About the only thing missing was a brass band playing \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">But on a mid-October day, just two months after he took the helm, Cornell took an unannounced detour from a business trip to Dallas. A friend connected him with an assortment of seven local moms, each of them loyal Target customers. Unrecognized by store workers, Cornell deployed each member of his ad hoc focus group to the department she frequented most\u2014clothing, housewares, or groceries, for example\u2014then waited for their reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">What Cornell sacrificed in pomp and circumstance, he made for up in candid opinions. The shoppers had a bevy of comments and complaints. Two Latina mothers criticized the bland colors and general drabness of Target\u2019s apparel. The younger moms told him that they buy only organic food for their babies; they wanted greater selection. By the end of his two hours in the store, Cornell had some germs of what only a few months later, as we\u2019ll see, are significant changes he is planning.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-0\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"0\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It may seem like a small step. But Cornell is the first Target CEO to be recruited from outside the company, and fittingly, he is already bringing a jolt of fresh energy to the country\u2019s third-largest retailer (behind only Wal-Mart and Costco). \u201cI got such great, genuine feedback from them,\u201d Cornell says of the Dallas visit. As he puts it, providing advance warning ensures stores are \u201cgoing to be beautiful\u2014but it\u2019s not reality.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar1-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-997604\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar1-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=328\" alt=\"TAR1-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"328\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A firm grip on reality is only the beginning of what Target needs today. A company that became a national phenomenon with retail alchemy\u2014a rare ability to attract millions with hip designer items at clear-out prices\u2014has seen that delicate formula stifled by excessive caution and a strangling bureaucracy, even as competitors emulated Target\u2019s approach, and fast-fashion retailers like H&amp;M, off-price chains such as T.J. Maxx, and dollar stores all muscled onto its turf. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4066900744001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066900744001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1EpgoN0\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dbriancornell%2Cphilwahba%2Ctarget%2Ctargetcorporation%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dtarget&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p class=\"p2\">Instead of cultivating its cachet as competition mounted and the economy <span class=\"s3\">struggled, Target instead emphasized low prices and unimaginative products.<br \/>\n<\/span>The doubly deadly result: The retailer is no longer winning on style <i>or<\/i> on price.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Target is drawing fewer shoppers. As of December, 37% of Americans had browsed in a Target store or its website in the preceding four weeks, according to data from Kantar Retail. In December 2007 the equivalent figure was 53%. That means millions of shoppers have abandoned Target. Despite the exodus, sales have ticked up during the past few years; Target is on track for $73 billion in 2014. What that means is that the company has become increasingly reliant on its core customers. It needs to attract fresh ones if it wants to reignite its growth.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then there\u2019s the value equation. In December 2007, Target scored a 48.4 on a scale that measures shoppers\u2019 sense that they get their money\u2019s worth, as compiled by YouGov BrandIndex. As of January 2015, that number had plunged to 31, erasing the company\u2019s long-standing edge over rival Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-1\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"1\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Those are the disconcerting trends for the long term. Then there were the <\/span>company\u2019s straight-up whiffs. A massive hacking in 2013 enraged customers. The company\u2019s subpar web presence left it gasping to catch its rivals. And finally it bungled its expansion into Canada in disastrous fashion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That array of woes has steadily chipped away at Target\u2019s profits. Earnings, which peaked at $3.2 billion a decade ago, are expected to be $1.5 billion for 2014. Net income as a percentage of sales has fallen from 4.5% to 2% during the same period, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, and gross profit margins have slipped.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s the situation facing Cornell. A former senior PepsiCo executive and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, he has made a name for himself in the retail world with a seemingly contradictory set of traits: He\u2019s a dyed-in-the-wool data guy who likes nothing more than nosing around a store and getting a feel for what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar2-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-997612\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar2-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=392\" alt=\"TAR2-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"392\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Since taking the reins in August, Cornell, 55, has moved quickly, seeking to speed up Target\u2019s metabolism. He aggressively squeezed Amazon and Wal-Mart by offering free shipping for online orders during the holidays. That decision was made in a matter of days rather than the months it would have taken in the past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The new CEO\u2019s most dramatic step so far: He ripped the bandage off Target\u2019s Canadian wound, a failed 2013 initiative that left the company bleeding. Closing all its stores north of the border cost $5.4 billion, but it stanched a key source of losses and will help the company concentrate on its U.S. business. Cornell\u2019s decisiveness, along with a better-than-expected holiday-season increase in sales at the website and stores open for at least a year, has revived Target\u2019s stock: The shares have jumped 30% under the new CEO, to all-time highs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell knows the plight of retailers that can\u2019t adapt, and he\u2019s the first to acknowledge that Target has a lot of work ahead. A key element will be improving the company\u2019s focus, which is CEO-speak for exiting or paring back certain business lines. \u201cThe categories we\u2019re going to stand for,\u201d he says, \u201cthe ones I call our signature categories\u2014they\u2019re the ones that can differentiate the brand going forward. So you\u2019ll see us elevate our focus around our style categories, apparel, home, beauty\u2014critically important categories for our guest\u2014and we think we can differentiate in that space.\u201d He also wants to \u201clocalize\u201d Target\u2019s product mix. The company plans to follow its customers as they move back to cities, with new urban locations that are smaller than its 1,800 big boxes, and stop playing catch-up when it comes to digital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-2\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"2\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Most of all, Target knows it needs to recapture its elusive ability to seduce. But as many a retailer (and many a teenager) has learned the hard way, wanting to be cool is a lot easier than actually being cool.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Up by his bootstraps&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">W<\/span><span class=\"s4\">hen Cornell arrived<\/span><b> <\/b>at Target\u2019s headquarters in Minneapolis, he was installed in the newly redone CEO\u2019s corner suite on the 26th floor. Almost immediately he insisted he be moved to a smaller office down the hall that is only steps away from the company\u2019s global data nerve center.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_81.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-996600\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_81.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=576\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">T<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">The data-monitoring hub at Target\u2019s headquarters<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Grab from Fortune Video<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s the company\u2019s mission-control-style monitoring room, which it calls \u201cguest central.\u201d There a team of 10 staffers scrutinizes live feeds from social media sites such as Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter, along with television stations, on nine large TV screens high on the wall. They watch intently and use software to aggregate data to gauge by-the-second reactions to a product launch or news<br \/>\nannouncement or to respond quickly to, say, a customer fulminating on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The social command center existed before Cornell became CEO. But he has beefed up its capabilities, and he\u2019s looking for creative ways to use the data. He drops in every morning and insists on two updates a day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Analytics have long been a central part of Cornell\u2019s approach. When he headed <span class=\"s3\">Sam\u2019s Club, the $55-billion-a-year Wal-Mart division, from 2009 to 2012,<br \/>\n<\/span>he improved the unit\u2019s customer-insights system, according to Maggie Nation, <span class=\"s3\">a marketing executive at Sam\u2019s under Cornell. The effort yielded such good results <\/span>that Wal-Mart had all of its insights teams report directly to Cornell.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell had previously upgraded analytics at Safeway, where he was chief marketing officer from 2004 to 2007. That data helped him ramp up the grocer\u2019s successful Lifestyle stores and led him to add higher-end touches like softer lighting, hardwood floors, and sushi bars. Cornell also loved to walk around stores, says Stuart Aitken, who worked under him at two companies. Cornell would grill customers about such minutiae as store lighting and which signs were hard to read. He would often take the clues he gathered in those conversations and use the analytics to look for broader patterns that would reveal problems or opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-3\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"3\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Cornell\u2019s emphasis on analytics <\/span>appealed to Target\u2019s board as it looked for a new CEO, according to the director who oversaw the search, Roxanne Austin, head of Austin Investment Advisors, a private investment and consulting firm. Cornell also boasted a track record of <span class=\"s2\">building private-label brands, a priority for Target, and had a reputation as a leader<\/span> who could rally the troops and change a culture. All of that trumped his inexperience in three areas that will be crucial to determining whether Target can get its mojo back: home goods, e-commerce, and clothing. (Cornell is trying to catch up: He was the first Target CEO to hobnob at New York Fashion Week in September.) \u201cNo one else had this set of experiences,\u201d Austin says. \u201cHe was the perfect guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">B<\/span><span class=\"s4\">rian Cornell\u2019s childhood<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> was anything but perfect\u2014or easy. His parents split up early, and Cornell was only 6 when he last saw his father, who died young. Cornell\u2019s mother suffered from heart disease through much of her life, and the two of them lived very modestly off her disability check in working-class White-stone, Queens. Eventually his mother\u2019s health declined to the point that Cornell\u2019s grandparents became his main caregivers. From the age that he could first make himself useful, Cornell says, he did odd jobs in his spare time: shoveling snow, mowing lawns, stacking bricks. \u201cI always had to work to fill in the gaps,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">As a teenager he spent summers cleaning trucks at a Tropicana distribution center near his home. Other retail jobs, along with gigs coaching high school football, helped him pay his way through college at UCLA. (Among the few objects displayed in Cornell\u2019s spare, immaculate office is an autographed UCLA football helmet from fellow alum and Dallas Cowboys legend Troy Aikman inscribed \u201cFrom one QB to another.\u201d) <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI had to scramble and scratch for everything I have,\u201d says Cornell. Even today, he says, \u201cI probably still wake up every day wanting to make sure I don\u2019t end up battling some of those same things I did when I was a kid,\u201d and adds, \u201cI\u2019m still my toughest critic.\u201d Despite all that, Cornell is approachable and genial, though he listens with an intensity that is almost alarming.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cIntense\u201d also applies to Cornell\u2019s workout regimen. It\u2019s not rare that a CEO would be found every morning at 7 a.m., as Cornell is, in the gym at company headquarters, on the treadmill as he fires off emails from his iPad. What\u2019s unusual is that on most days he returns to the gym for a second session after work. About <span class=\"s3\">15 years ago Cornell attended the \u201ccorporate athlete program\u201d at the Human <\/span>Performance Institute, making him a zealot for optimizing performance not only with exercise but also with adequate sleep.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cornell isn\u2019t the type who exalts the machismo of outlandish hours. Just the opposite. It\u2019s not unusual for him to inquire about a colleague\u2019s workout habits and make specific recommendations. Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of PepsiCo Latin America Foods, says his former boss would gently chide him to shoot for 200 minutes of exercise a week, extolling the sound mind he said stems from a sound body. He says Cornell encouraged him to take time for fitness on their business trips.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_3-resized.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-996294\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_3-resized.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=1469\" alt=\"Brian Cornell, CEO of Target\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1469\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">Cornell with designs from Target&#8217;s forthcoming collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell was always ambitious. But from the outside, he looked like a corporate lifer, spending 20 years ascending inside Tropicana and then its subsequent owner, PepsiCo. But his<br \/>\nimpatience to land a major CEO position eventually set him in motion. He began hopscotching through a series of senior positions at different companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell worked at Safeway from 2004 to 2007 as chief of marketing, as CEO of Michaels Stores from 2007 to 2009, then as CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. At each stop he expanded the chain\u2019s house brands. At Sam\u2019s Club, Cornell helped reverse a sales decline and made it the fastest-growing division of Wal-Mart. Cornell was briefly viewed as a contender to succeed Mike Duke but left in part because his wife never cottoned to life in Bentonville, Ark. \u2009Cornell returned to PepsiCo in 2012 to head the Americas operations for Frito-Lay and other foods. He was whispered about as a potential PepsiCo CEO. But when Target called, he didn\u2019t hesitate. As he puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s a dream job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;The rise of cheap chic&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">T<\/span><span class=\"s4\">arget\u2019s history turns <\/span><span class=\"s2\">on two well-timed decisions. The first was the realization by Dayton\u2019s department store that customers were flocking to the less expensive wares it was selling in its basement. That was the genesis of Target, in 1962, a year that also saw the birth of Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Kohl\u2019s. Wal-Mart in particular would cast a shadow over its smaller rival. By the late 1980s its low prices were squeezing Target. That led to the second crucial decision, in the mid-1990s. Target could set itself apart by offering something its rivals didn\u2019t: clothing and kitchenware with panache and low prices. (Excellent marketing didn\u2019t hurt either.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-4\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"4\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By 1999, Target had attained a chic that was nearly inconceivable for a discounter. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">It launched the first of what have so far been 150 collaborations with leading <\/span>designers, offering teakettles by renowned architect Michael Graves. Later collections, with Isaac Mizrahi in 2002 and Italian fashion house Missoni in 2011, were smashes, too, and established such offerings as Target\u2019s signature strategy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Great Recession threw the company off its stride. Being trendy seemed like an indulgence in a time of depressed wages and underemployment. Target\u2019s marketing began echoing Wal-Mart\u2019s dogma of frugal prices rather than fun and flair. Target cut back the shelf space it was devoting to unique, unproven merchandise\u2014whether it was home goods or clothing\u2014and reduced the quality of some of its apparel to keep costs down. Meanwhile, Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s, and H&amp;M were imitating the company with their own designer collaborations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Target was standing out less and less. To generate visits the company added more groceries, but without any distinctive touch to set it apart. By 2013 food, a notoriously low-margin business, had grown to a fifth of its revenue. Target had concentrated too much on the \u201cpay less\u201d part of its mantra and not enough on the \u201cexpect more\u201d part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_7.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-994741\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_7.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=958&#038;h=650\" alt=\"Target Canada\" width=\"958\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">A Target in Toronto in February, weeks after the company announced it was pulling out of Canada.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Darren Calabrese \u2014 The Canadian Press\/AP<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Then came two epic corporate wipe-outs. Target\u2019s move into Canada was <\/span>a fiasco. Rather than launching new <span class=\"s2\">stores in carefully selected spots and building slowly, Target acquired 124 locations in 2013 in one fell swoop by buying all the outlets from a defunct discounter called Zellers. Never mind that one of the causes of Zellers\u2019 demise was the poor location of its stores. Or that the spaces were designed to enable a different strategy from Target\u2019s. Throw in supply-chain problems that yielded empty shelves and high prices, and it <\/span>added up to an unmitigated disaster.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then there was a second calamity. In the final days of the 2013 holiday shopping season, Target disclosed <span class=\"s2\">that hackers had obtained as many as 70 million customer records. Though such intrusions seem to occur almost daily today, at the time it was the worst retail hacking in history. Customers were livid. They punished Target, and business slowed well into 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By that spring the pressure had built, and something had to give. As often happens, it was the chief executive who gave. In May 2014, Gregg Steinhafel, a superb merchandiser who\u2019d been integral to Target\u2019s rise but stiff and cautious as CEO, resigned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Corporate soul-searching&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">W<\/span><span class=\"s4\">hile the confluence<b> <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\">of the data breach, the Canadian disaster, and Steinhafel\u2019s departure was traumatic, it may have been the shock Target needed. CFO John Mulligan, who was named interim CEO, started a four-month corporate soul-searching effort. \u201cThe truth is, we haven\u2019t kept up,\u201d Mulligan told staff in an email on May 6, the day after Steinhafel left. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight harder to give our guests what they want.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Target intensified efforts to improve its second-rate website. Its capabilities had fallen behind those of Wal-Mart, which had the capacity to use a big chunk of its stores to help fill online orders a year before Target did. The company rewrote three-quarters of the code for its website and has now caught up to, or even surpassed, some rivals. Target\u2019s Cartwheel coupon-tracking app is now considered an industry leader, downloaded 13 million times, and has generated $1 billion in sales so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Under Mulligan, Target took symbolic yet practical steps, such as consolidating its top executives on the 26th floor of its headquarters to make it easier to talk to one another. Target relaxed its dress code last March, elating the staff by leaving sartorial decisions largely to common sense. (Even in the company\u2019s most formal days, there was a standing exemption for any shirt in Target\u2019s signature red worn with khakis.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-5\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"5\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell has loosened the atmosphere in other ways. He eats in the company cafeteria, where he mingles with staff. He opened Target\u2019s annual fall meeting to the press for the first time. The company has set up a lounge on the executive floor where employees can check out what merchandise is in the pipeline and swap ideas in a relaxed environment. And the company, long populated by lifers, is redoubling efforts to recruit outsiders with fresh ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cIt\u2019s not that we <i>became<\/i> insular. We <i>were<\/i> insular,\u201d says Jeff Jones, Target\u2019s marketing boss. \u201cIf you need to go faster, you need people who\u2019ve done it. We didn\u2019t have enough people who\u2019d done it before.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell certainly qualifies as an outsider, and his resolution of the Canada question showed the speed of his decision-making. The fate of the operations was sealed when the CEO made a solo journey to some Montreal-area stores the Saturday before Christmas, the busiest day of the season in retail. As Cornell wandered among the empty aisles, he peppered his CFO with texts. He concluded that painful as it was to admit, it would take too much time and treasure to fix the Canadian operation. Less than three weeks later Target announced it was shuttering all its stores there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_4.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-994738\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_4.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=975&#038;h=650\" alt=\"CEO of Target Brian Cornell\" width=\"975\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">Cornell examines a new housewares display.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Three years or bust&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">I<\/span><span class=\"s1\">t\u2019s early February <\/span>and Cornell is back in a Target again. As he strides through its outlet in northeast Minneapolis, which doubles as its \u201cliving lab,\u201d he points out how Target is displaying its kitchenware. Rather than plates, mats, and utensils stocked separately, they are presented together in realistic kitchen and table settings. The idea is to help customers imagine mixing and matching items in the way that countless retailers have been doing for decades.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">It seems symbolic. The CEO is a whirl of ideas and initiatives, but most of them appear incremental and one or another of its rivals has some version of most of them. For example, Target is trying out a new \u201cfirst impressions\u201d area at the front of a few stores, looking to highlight choice items, such as an elegant soup bowl, in an appealing presentation. It would be a step up from the bins with $1 tchotchkes that currently welcome shoppers. And Target is taking electronics like iPads out of glass cases so that customers can try them out. (One plan that seems more unusual: Target is testing a service in which a brand-agnostic staffer will offer advice to parents of infants. The baby and maternity category is essential to capturing the next generation of shoppers, he says, and defines a group that visits Target stores most often.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell acknowledges that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we\u2019re talking about where someone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u2019\u2009\u201d But, he says, \u201cfrom a Target standpoint, they\u2019ve never seen us bundle these key initiatives.\u201d And, he argues, \u201cthey will add up to a very bold change for the brand and the business\u2009\u2026\u2009If we execute the plan over the next few years, you will say, \u2018Boy, Target made a huge transformation.\u2019\u2009\u201d He\u2019s giving himself and his team three years to deliver.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_5-copy.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Target Express\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">The first TargetExpress in Minneapolis with food on display.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The CEO plans to focus on categories in which Target believes it can win and trim elsewhere. (In February, for example, he pulled the plug on Target\u2019s video-streaming service.) That means more store brands. Cornell\u2019s Safeway experience is instructive. Early to see the opportunity in organic foods, he was the architect of the grocer\u2019s O Organics brand, which took off. Today, mere months after the moms in the Dallas store told him they wanted more organic foods for their babies, Cornell has a goal: He wants organic items to account for 60% of the company\u2019s baby food sales within two years, up from 40% now. That would address a key challenge: to make Target\u2019s food selection more distinctive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cornell is likely to accelerate Target\u2019s roll out of its smaller outlets, such as its 100,000-square-foot CityTarget stores aimed at urban consumers. The company is also experimenting with highly customized 20,000-square-foot TargetExpress neighborhood mini-stores, the second of which will open next month in the Bay Area. Of course, Wal-Mart already has 700 small-format (primarily grocery) stores. Walgreens now sells fresh food in many stores, and even Family Dollar is improving its selection. And outside of the food aisles, other retailers and department stores are still on the hunt for the hip-and-cheap sweet spot.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-6\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"6\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So is Cornell. In November, Target collaborated with Story, a trendy boutique in New York City\u2019s Chelsea that creates a new theme every month and changes the look and merchandise accordingly. Just six weeks elapsed from the time Cornell first showed up at Story in September, introducing himself as \u201cBrian from Target,\u201d to the opening. In the old days that would\u2019ve taken many months. Story spotlighted Target brands like Archer Farms, as well as some exclusive products by TOMS and Nate Berkus. It was a way for Target, and Cornell, to keep a finger on the pulse of what\u2019s cool.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Should the CEO personally be leading the search for the next hit teakettle? Maybe not. The company may or may not succeed at luring new customers. But Cornell will surely be one of the first to know. He\u2019ll be in the aisles, finding out for himself.\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>More from Fortune:<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:red;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/15\/target-canada-fail\/\">Why Target failed in Canada<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:red;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/02\/target-express\/\">Target taking its small Express stores to more markets<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 08:00:23","updated":"2015-02-19 08:00:23","minute":"8:00 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Target has a new CEO: Will he re-energize the retailer?","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/f03-01-15_cover1.jpg?quality=80&w=800&h=661&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_featured_small_2x","credit":"Photograph by Bartholomew Cooke ","caption":"","attach_id":997708},"excerpt":"","authors":[{"id":"345187","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/phil-wahba\/","name":"Phil Wahba","twitter":"philwahba","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/twitter_wahba.jpg?quality=80&amp;w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"PHIL WAHBA\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/twitter_wahba.jpg?quality=80&w=55",55,55,false],"bio":"Phil Wahba is a writer for Fortune","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune The Target executives were taken aback.

It is unclear what the fallout would be if Greece were to impose capital controls and leave the euro, but it seems that Germany and the ECB just don&#8217;t care anymore.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Greece&#8217;s new left-wing government blinked on Thursday morning in its month-long standoff with its eurozone partners, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/02\/19\/eurozone-greece-request-idUSL5N0VT2S720150219\"><span class=\"s1\">saying<\/span><\/a> that it would agree to a six-month extension of the expiring bailout agreement at its current terms so that the two sides could have more time to negotiate. It was a typical &#8220;kick the can down the road&#8221; move we have come to expect from EU officials, something that Greece&#8217;s new government promised it wouldn&#8217;t do just a couple days earlier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The markets rallied on the news, with Greek bank stocks shooting up 10% and Greek 10-year bonds yields falling back to the single digits. The so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/256125514\/Greek-Finance-Min-presentations-at-Eurogroup-11-15-Feb-2015#download\"><span class=\"s1\">radical<\/span><\/a>&#8221; Greek government finally fell in line with the status quo, and that itself was enough for the market to chill out and hobble onward.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But in a shocking turn of events, Germany&#8217;s finance ministry rejected the Greek proposal, saying that it amounted to a bridge financing deal that didn&#8217;t propose any &#8220;substantial&#8221; solutions to the problem at hand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, what has changed? Did Germany truly expect a real solution to this issue? Or was the finance ministry just pretending to play hardball to save face with the German public? This wouldn&#8217;t be the first time for Germany to claim it was calling Greece&#8217;s bluff and then fall apart at the end of the day. It has happened pretty much every time Germany has negotiated a bailout deal since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2009.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this time could be different. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.faz.net\/aktuell\/wirtschaft\/eurokrise\/griechenland\/notenbanker-verlieren-den-glauben-an-griechenland-ezb-verhandelt-ueber-ela-kredite-13436284.html\"><span class=\"s1\">report<\/span><\/a> in German newspaper <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung<\/em> quotes an unnamed central banker from the ECB who believes that the Grexit may now be inevitable. &#8220;One gets the impression that the Greeks want to get out [of the euro] and are just looking for an escape goat,&#8221; at this point, the unnamed central banker told the paper.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This comes a couple weeks after the ECB <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/06\/greece-germany-eurozone-fate\/\"><span class=\"s1\">abruptly<\/span><\/a> stopped taking Greek sovereign bonds from Greek banks as collateral for low-cost loans to fund their operations. The ECB had been loaning the banks money and accepting the junk Greek debt at face value even though it was worth a fraction of that amount in the real world, something that, naturally, angered Germany.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ECB pulled this cheap financing as Greeks were pulling money out of the their banks amid growing fear of a Grexit, when the Greek banks needed the money the most. The Greek banks were forced to turn to their own central bank for cash, which also borrows from the ECB, but at a higher interest rate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All this has accelerated the run on the Greek banks, forcing the Greek Central Bank to borrow at a frenetic pace from the ECB to make sure they have enough cash on hand to meet demand. But there is a limit to how much the Greek Central Bank can borrow from the ECB, 65 billion euros, and it appears that they just hit the ceiling. The Greeks reportedly asked the ECB to increase their line of credit by 10 billion euros, but the ECB agreed in an emergency meeting overnight that it would only increase it by 3 billion euros.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ECB knows very well that money buys the Greek banks a week, two weeks tops. The Greek banks won&#8217;t need the money if the panic stops, but that won&#8217;t happen unless Germany relents and agrees to Greece&#8217;s demand for leniency. With Germany saying <em>N<\/em><i>ein<\/i> today just to extend talks without granting any concessions, it is now clear that the whole situation may actually blow up this time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Greece will then have to make a tough choice. They will either need to accept total defeat and continue on with the terms of the bailout agreement, which would probably result in a Greek default in a few months time, or they can institute capital controls (which would restrict people&#8217;s ability to withdraw cash), default on the bailout now, and leave the euro.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Will the Grexit cause the euro to fall apart? Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, famously promised that he would do &#8220;whatever it takes &#8221; to save the euro, so a Grexit may not automatically mean the end of the currency union. He has been preparing for years to counter the backlash that would follow a Grexit, most recently by announcing a multi-billion euro quantitative easing program that could stabilize the bond yields of EU countries if they explode post-Grexit. Will it be enough? No one knows for sure.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Greece, neither of its option seems acceptable at this point. For some reason, Greeks overwhelmingly want to stay in the euro, which is why the Greek government swallowed its pride and agreed to kick the can down the road. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the current head of the Euro group negotiations with Greece, called for a fourth &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; meeting tomorrow of finance ministers to discuss the Greek plan. While Dijsselbloem is somewhat hopeful that a deal can be struck\u2014he said at the last meeting that he wouldn&#8217;t call another unless he thought a deal was close\u2014it will be impossible to strike an agreement without German backing, meaning a Grexit could be just around the corner.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 02:30:07","updated":"2015-02-19 02:30:07","minute":"2:30 PM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Germany may have just put the nail in Greece's Euro zone coffin","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4069505142001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4069505142001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/17hIAGS\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Decb%2Ceuro%2Cgreece%2Cgrexit%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dgreece&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"Germany's finance ministry rejected Greek's request for an extension to its expiring bailout agreement.

That\u2019s what they\u2019re intending to do here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tsedeye Gebreselassie, a senior staff attorney at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project, called Walmart\u2019s $9 minimum wage antiquated. \u201cIf they\u2019d made this announcement a few years ago, it would\u2019ve been a significant step for low-wage workers.\u201d But with states and cities setting double-digit minimum wages, $9 \u201cis a bit behind the curve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart says that it had been looking at raising its associates&#8217; wages for a while and made its announcement on Thursday after talking to their employees to figure out \u201cwhat it is that they\u2019re looking for overall in a job. Starting wage is part of that,\u201d Kory Lundberg, a Wal-Mart spokesman, told <em>Fortune<\/em>. Lundberg also noted that Wal-Mart listens to its &#8220;critics.&#8221; He said $9 an hour \u201cis a good number for us; it made sense for our associates.\u201d Lundberg also said that increasing the starting wage any more than that would have set \u201cthe first rung of the economic ladder too high,\u201d making the jobs \u201cunattainable\u201d for workers seeking entry level experience. Once the company institutes its $9 minimum wage in April, part-time Wal-Mart workers nationwide will earn $10 per hour on average; full-timers will make $13.<\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart plans to adjust the $9 starting wage to account for regional cost of living. Chris Tilly, director of UCLA\u2019s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, pointed out that the areas where the $15 minimum wage has gained the most traction are big, expensive markets. The heart of Wal-Mart&#8217;s business, meanwhile, is in the rural United States. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/07\/business\/a-respite-in-efforts-by-wal-mart-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">In fact, the retail has often had trouble breaking into large metropolitan areas.<\/a>) \u201c[Wal-Mart\u2019s] not trying to impress urban sophisticates. Its customers are shopping at Wal-Mart to get a lot at a low price. [Wal-Mart] wants to speak to that constituency in the heartland.\u201d Perhaps, then, $9 per hour does the trick.<\/p>\n<p>But by lowballing the minimum wage movement\u2019s $15 demand, Wal-Mart may have missed an opportunity to make a major, sweeping change in the lives of low-wage workers throughout the nation. \u201cWal-Mart not only can do better; it has an obligation to,\u201d Gebreselassie, says. \u201cAs one of the largest employer, what it does really sets the standard for the [retail] sector.\u201d<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19

Warren Buffett and George Soros, have increased their already substantial holdings of General Motors Co. <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gm\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> stock, a sign that smart money has decided its shares are undervalued.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Harry Wilson, the representative of four investment funds holding around 2% of GM common stock, announced the funds want the automaker to buy back $8 billion worth of stock and appoint him to its board of directors. Wilson, in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/gm-shareholder-seeks-spot-on-board-1423577927\">interview<\/a> with the Wall Street Journal, said GM must be \u201cmore attentive to its cash balance and its operating performance\u201d and address \u201cshareholder frustration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The moves by Buffett and Soros were disclosed in filings reflecting increased holdings of GM shares in the fourth quarter of last year, prior to Wilson\u2019s public announcement. Neither has said anything critical of GM; Buffett earlier expressed support for GM management. Each of the men has also expressed interest in <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/29\/why-george-soros-warren-buffett-and-bill-gates-want-auto-dealerships\/\">buying retail automobile dealerships<\/a> in the U.S., Buffett having an agreement to acquire the privately owned Van Tuyl group.<\/p>\n<p>Whether other major investors, and possible other so-called activist investors, decide to join forces to exert pressure on GM isn\u2019t clear \u2013 but investors may be sniffing a potential opportunity at GM: Since early February, the automaker\u2019s share price has moved up more than 12% in an overall market that has gained less than 4%.<\/p>\n<p>Has GM management been successful in remaking the automaker after its 2009 bankruptcy? Evidently, some investors don\u2019t think so, though GM insiders argue that Mary Barra, the chief executive, has made much progress. She\u2019s now feeling Wall Street pressure to do more \u2013 and why not? As the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21642169-why-activist-investors-are-good-public-company-capitalisms-unlikely-heroes\">cover story<\/a> of the February 7 issue of The Economist argued persuasively, activist investors can be effective change agents, turbocharging underperforming public corporations to the benefit of shareholders.<\/p>\n<p>Taconic Parties, Appaloosa Parties, HG Vora Parties and Hayman Parties, which own more than 2% of the automaker, want to be represented on GM\u2019s board, Wilson said. They also want GM to initiate a big share buyback, which theoretically would make remaining shares more valuable.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Buffett and Soros haven\u2019t elaborated publicly about their increases in GM share holdings. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"brk.a\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/brk-a\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">brk.a<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> increased its holdings by one million shares to 41 million, roughly 2.5%. Soros Fund Management raised its position by 728,938 to 4.9 million shares, or less than 1%.<\/p>\n<p>The Detroit-based automaker has a rich history contending with activists: Ross Perot in the mid-1980s. Kirk Kerkorian and Jerry York in 2006. Neither could get through the stubbornness of GM\u2019s executives and directors determined to stay the course. Leading the charge this time is Wilson, 43, an investment banker representing the investment funds. He worked to restructure GM following its bankruptcy in 2009 while working for the U.S. Treasury.<\/p>\n<p>Using publicly available information, The Economist noted that activist investors have mounted campaigns at about 15% of the firms in the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009, demanding board seats, strategy changes and the ouster of executives. Among them: Nelson Peltz at Pepsi. Bill Ackman at Canadian Pacific Railways and Burger King. Carl Icahn at Apple and eBay. Their effectiveness can be debated. In some cases, companies undertook suggested changes, saying they intended to do so anyway. In others, company performance improved, relieving the pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Dissident and activist shareholders once were seen as opportunists, gambling on a payoff\u2014\u201cgreenmail\u201d\u2014or a short-term improvement of share price. The rise of private equity investors represented a different form of activism in which the entire company was bought at a premium, loaded with debt and then restructured. Today\u2019s activist would say the focus is longer-term performance.<\/p>\n<p>With one eye on the activists, corporate boards monitor dividend and stock performance carefully and take steps, lest shareholders grow restive. But shareholders increasingly are large mutual and other funds rather than individuals. Funds tend to sell their stakes when performance lags or avoid sleepy companies altogether.<\/p>\n<p>No one can question the disappointing performance of GM\u2019s stock since the public offering in late 2010, or the simmering political controversy over the $10 billion it cost the U.S. to bail out the automaker. GM\u2019s recent signal that it intends to raise the dividend relates directly to the flat share price.<\/p>\n<p>But GM senior executives also assert the post-bankruptcy automaker is a leaner, more nimble performer \u2013 albeit one that tripped badly in 2014: The ignition-switch safety recalls and reparations have cost multiple billions that might otherwise have been realized as profits. Perhaps sensing investor impatience, GM indicated it intends to raise its quarterly cash dividend.<\/p>\n<p>Alan Batey, president of GM North America, is a native of Great Britain who started with the company 35 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot of defense in the last year,\u201d Batey said in an interview earlier this month at the Chicago Auto Show, referring to the recalls of tens of millions of GM vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget what our dealers have done to help us. They\u2019ve been through hell and back. We\u2019re indebted to them, and this year we\u2019ll play offense.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The annealing qualities of GM\u2019s crises may make its management team tougher and more determined than ever to succeed. If not, a board seat and share buyback may turn out to an opening salvo in a longer, broader conflict over the automaker\u2019s performance.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"

compensation as CEO Doug McMillon. The answer? It would take more than 2.8 million hours of earning $9 per hour to reach the roughly $25.6 million in compensation McMillon earned in 2014, his first year on the job. (That number would come down to roughly 2.6 million hours with next year&#8217;s additional hourly increase.)<\/p>\n<p>For those wondering, there are only 8,760 hours in a calendar year and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management estimates the average number of actual work hours in a year to be 2,087. Using the latter figure, a Wal-Mart employee earning the new minimum hourly wage of $9 per hour would have to work more than 1,360 years in order to equal McMillon&#8217;s 2014 compensation.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"12\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4003013008001-12\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4003013008001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1BqBooQ\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dbusinessnews%2Cdirect2cashprogram%2Cretailnews%2Cwalmartcheckingaccount%2Cwalmartdirect2cash%2Cwalmartgobank%2Cwalmartincometax%2Cwalmarttaxpreparers%2Cwalmarttaxrefundprogram%2Cwalmarttaxseason%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dwalmartdirect2cash&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/services.corporate-ir.net\/SEC.Enhanced\/SecCapsule.aspx?c=112761&amp;fid=9407967\">total compensation<\/a> for Wal-Mart&#8217;s CEO last year included a base salary of about $950,000, plus more than $23 million in stock awards, along with additional incentives.<\/p>\n<p>McMillon took over for former Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke a year ago amid a string of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/07\/25\/can-a-new-ceo-rescue-walmarts-u-s-sales\/\">disappointing quarterly U.S. sales numbers<\/a> for the retail giant. McMillon&#8217;s promotion earned him a hefty raise last year after he took home around $10 million a year earlier as head of the company&#8217;s international business. In the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart reported a better-than-expected U.S. sales bump as well as a 1.4% increase in total revenue.<\/p>\n<p>The news comes at a time of intense debate over what constitutes fair pay for low-wage workers and it follows <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/10\/17\/business\/walmart-workers-seek-wage-bump.html\">protests last fall<\/a> by Wal-Mart employees seeking a base pay of $15 per hour for all company employees.

The boom is driven by health reforms that are disrupting business models, an aging population that&#8217;s demanding more (and better) care, and the adoption of technology \u2014 such as wearables and video chat \u2014 into the medical mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that boom the fact that it\u2019s a golden age for entrepreneurship, where the declining cost of technology means more entrepreneurs than ever have the tools to build new companies, and you have all the ingredients for a startup revolution in health care.<\/p>\n<p>Last year was dubbed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.startuphealth.com\/content\/insights-2014\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;The Year Digital Health Broke Out&#8221;<\/a> by Startup Health, a leading New York City-based accelerator and networking platform.

It was founded by longtime business partners Steven Krein and Unity Stoakes. The two men have worked together since 1997, first launching and selling a startup, and then coaching entrepreneurs.

Health care entrepreneurs have needs that are different to those of other entrepreneurs; their challenges are unique. There&#8217;s regulation and entrenched stakeholders. The lead times are longer. You have to play within the system, and that means there are a lot more challenges when it comes to succeeding as a startup in the health care space.<\/p>\n<p>Here, Stoakes and Krein offer advice for what it takes to make it as a startup in the industry.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"15\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3977920542001-15\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3977920542001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1G2Cx4X\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/uncategorized_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Daffordablecareact%2Cdeductibles%2Cemployerprovidedhealthplans%2Chealthcarecosts%2Chealthinsurancecosts%2Cobamacare%2Cpremiums%2Cstatebystatehealthinsurance%2Cstudy%2Cthecommonwealthfund%26ch%3Duncategorized%26topic%3Dhealthcarecosts&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p><strong>1.

In healthcare, the large stakeholders are so important,&#8221; said Stoakes. &#8220;You really need to be working with these corporate and government partners in order to speed up what&#8217;s actually possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Settle in for a long slog.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can go to places like Silicon Valley and there&#8217;s these short-term bootcamps where you hear stories like \u2018Slack grew from zero to a billion dollars in nine months,\u2019&#8221; said Stoakes. &#8220;In healthcare, the sales cycles are very long, and regulatory hurdles can take significant time and the resistance to change is high, so the entire cycle is elongated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an intense amount of patience needed to be an entrepreneur in general, and in health care even more so,&#8221; Krein said. &#8220;You need to think of it as a five to 10 year minimum kind of initiative. You might get lucky, you might get taken out, you might IPO, but the reality is that it&#8217;s going to take a long time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. It&#8217;s all about the network.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it all comes down to it, Stoakes and Krein name two key elements that make a successful health care entrepreneur: being collaborative and coachable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to know everything, and you need to be open to being coached. Be open to other experts, ideas and suggestions. Listen really well at every stage,&#8221; Krein said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to be a rugged individualist in this sector, in particular. It helps to be part of an army of entrepreneurs working together.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 03:14:40","updated":"2015-02-19 03:14:40","minute":"3:14 PM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/healthcare-startups-succeed\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/healthcare-startups-succeed\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/healthcare-startups-succeed\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Health care startups are booming.

You\u2019re always in over your head at first, because nothing in your experience is similar to this,\u201d she says. \u201cAuthenticity as a leader is an outcome, not a starting point, and your true self as a manager isn\u2019t going to be the same as your old self.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So how do you get from here to there? \u201cAsking advice from peers may not get you very far, because people tend to tell you things like, \u2018Just be more confident,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Ibarra notes. You could also try emulating a favorite boss, adapting his or her style to your current job. But \u201cyou have a different personality, a different team, and different circumstances. So that may not work either.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The most successful leaders Ibarra has studied have grown comfortable with bigger roles by emulating more experienced leaders in their own organizations. \u201cPay close attention to particular things others do well \u2014 how they run a meeting, how they project competence, how they give feedback,\u201d Ibarra says. If possible, recreate the old mentoring approach by getting to know higher-ups better. \u201cAsk them who influenced them, and how they think about what they do,\u201d she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>The point isn\u2019t to imitate anyone, which could make you feel like even more of a phony, but to gather ideas that might be helpful in refining your own style. <em>Act Like a Leader <\/em>quotes martial arts guru Bruce Lee, who counseled anyone learning a new skill to \u201cuse only that which works, and take it from anywhere you can find it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The main thing that will make you feel like less of a fraud: Time. \u201cThere really is no such thing as a \u2018born leader,\u2019 and no one correct way\u201d to become accustomed to leading, Ibarra says. \u201cYou have to try things and experiment with different approaches until you find you\u2019ve grown into it.\u201d At only two months in your current job, you\u2019re just getting started. Says Ibarra, \u201cIt takes time, so be generous and a bit forgiving of yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Talkback:<\/strong> If you\u2019ve ever felt you were \u201cfaking it\u201d in a new job, how did you get over that?

The progress shows Wal-Mart&#8217;s efforts to improve its selection of fresh food (grocery is 55% of company sales), its e-commerce firepower and adequate staffing of shelves are starting to show results.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time, Wal-Mart offered investors plenty to worry about (shares fell 3%, wiping $6 billion off its market value), with plenty of investments intended to improve business but that will lead to a lower profit in the fiscal year that just started. It also gave a tepid sales forecast. Much of the improvement in its U.S. performance had more to do with low gas prices and better weather than its retail prowess. Here is a rundown of some of the points of concern in Wal-Mart&#8217;s results <a href=\"http:\/\/news.walmart.com\/news-archive\/investors\/2015\/02\/19\/walmart-announces-q4-underlying-eps-of-161-and-additional-strategic-investments-in-people-e-commerce-walmart-us-comp-sales-increased-15-percent\">report<\/a> issued today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. E-commerce growth fell short of expectations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart has pumped billions into its e-commerce operations as it fights against Amazon.com <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/amzn\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/\">resurgent Target<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TGT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/tgt\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TGT<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> but that yielded an 18% increase in digital sales in the holiday quarter, which Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon called &#8220;solid, but not quite as strong as we wanted.&#8221; E-commerce sales are still only about 3% of sales. (Last year, the e-commerce growth had been 30%.) The world&#8217;s largest retailer blamed the shortfall on slumping electronics sales (Walmart was particularly aggressive during the holidays in slashing television prices) and a lack of video games for new consoles. The company said it plans to spend as much as 9 cents per share, or $290 million, on improving its e-commerce, to remedy that, even if it means smaller profit margins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Gross profit margin was unchanged during the holiday season despite the sales increase<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So shoppers spent more, visited more (shopper traffic rose 1.4% last quarter, the first increase in 9 quarters) and their mood improved\u2014that yielded a sales increase but an unchanged gross profit margin. That can only mean Walmart cut prices (&#8216;rollbacks&#8217; in company parlance) during the holiday too aggressively, a strategy that was plain to see, what with the company starting Black Friday deals on Nov. 1 and being hard-core in its discounting all the way through the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>Walmart also spent a lot of money to staff more cash registers during the holiday period to address a long time complaint of many shoppers: end lines lines and wait times at checkout.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Comparable sales rose, but far more modestly than the competition&#8217;s<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>U.S. comparable sales, which include online sales and sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1.5%, better than the 0.7% rise analysts expected, and the second straight quarter of growth (after nearly two years of decline or stagnation). But the number could have been better. For one thing, gas prices hit multi-year lows, pumping an extra $5 billion in Americans&#8217; pockets this holiday. For another, last year, Walmart U.S.&#8217; sales had been hurt by cuts to the food stamp programs 20% of customers relied on, making the year-over-year comparison easier to beat for Walmart in 2014. Competitors from Target to J.C. Penney <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"JCP\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/jcp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">JCP<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> to Kohl&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KSS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/kss\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KSS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> all did better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. The wage increase and more training will help customer service, but at a cost<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart made waves on Thursday when it announced raises for 500,000 U.S. associates to make sure they make at least $9 an hour and offering more training and adding back department managers, part of its efforts to offer &#8220;a better store experience,&#8221; according to McMillon. All that will dent profits this year to the tune of $1 billion. &#8220;Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates,&#8221; McMillon said on a pre-recorded call to announced the quarterly results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Some key international markets\u2014i.e. China, Britain and Brazil\u2014still tough<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart was the latest U.S. company to warn investors that the strong greenback was hurting sales\u2014in this case, the damage is to the tune of $5 billion. But beyond the currency crunch, Wal-Mart is getting hit in myriad ways in different key countries. In Britain, it was taken by surprise by how much U.K. rivals took to Black Friday, until this year a purely American shopping event. In China, it continued to struggle with shoppers&#8217; perceptions that its prices were not low enough or its food fresh enough. (In Canada, its comparable sales rose, and with Target almost gone from the market, it should see more growth.)<\/p>\n<p>On the whole the company forecast a profit of $4.70 to $5.05 per share this year, the midpoint of which is below the $4.99 Wal-Mart reported for 2014. And it expects U.S. comparable sales (Walmart US is 60% of its business) to rise 1-2% this quarter.<\/p>\n<p>All this shows just how much work is still ahead for Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 03:45:58","updated":"2015-02-19 03:45:58","minute":"3:45 PM

Lonsdale and Clougherty\u2019s relationship evolves from that of a mentor and mentee into a romantic relationship and then, Clougherty alleges, into something much more disturbing\u2014including sexual harassment and assault. Clougherty took the case to Stanford officials and Lonsdale was banned from the Stanford campus for ten years (though that ban seems theoretical at best, given that, according to Bazelon, \u201cLonsdale has been invited to campus for a private lunch which he attended with the university\u2019s permission.\u201d). Clougherty filed a civil suit in January and Lonsdale has <a href=\"http:\/\/joelonsdalestatement.com\/\">responded, vigorously<\/a>, and filed a countersuit, denying Clougherty\u2019s accusations.<\/p>\n<p>Clougherty graduated from Stanford in 2013 and is looking to build a career that involves brain research, tech and social activism.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a murky situation\u2014but a mentoring relationship went horribly wrong. Clearly both professional and personal boundaries were crossed inappropriately\u2014and a young woman who was supposed to be mentored and encouraged professionally was, instead, embroiled in what was, at <em>best<\/em>, an unhealthy relationship with someone who possessed undue influence.<\/p>\n<p>There is ample evidence that mentoring for college students can have a significant impact on how prepared recent graduates feel as they enter the workplace. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2014\/05\/06\/gallup-surveys-graduates-gauge-whether-and-why-college-good-well-being\">2014 Gallup study<\/a> of 30,000 college students found that mentoring opportunities were remarkably important to long term career success and satisfaction. Brandon Busteed, the executive director of Gallup Education <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/views\/2014\/09\/25\/essay-about-importance-mentors-college-students\">noted<\/a> how the study revealed that, \u201cthe three most potent elements linked to long-term success for college grads relate to emotional support: feeling that they had a professor who made them excited about learning, that the professors at their alma mater cared about them as a person, and that they had a mentor who encouraged them to pursue their goals and dreams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lonsdale never treated Clougherty as someone who had goals and dreams. Instead, Lonsdale, by engaging in a personal relationship with his young mentee, treated her as a romantic conquest. He ignored his professional responsibility for personal gain. Lonsdale insists that, \u201cEllie is a forceful person,\u201d as if, somehow, that negates the inherent power imbalance not only in a mentor\/mentee relationship, but also between a 21-year old college student and a hugely successful 29-year old entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p>It should go without saying, but mentors cannot treat the mentor\/mentee relationship as a garden of earthly delights. They have one primary responsibility in such a relationship\u2014to provide support and guidance for young men and women. Mentees are not potential romantic interests or sexual conquests. They are not potential acolytes or personal assistants. The mentor\/mentee relationship is a professional one and should be treated as such. If there is a temptation to cross lines, resist. There is a responsibility attached to being a mentor. Mentors must live up to that responsibility. It really is that simple.<\/p>\n<p>Alumni are a natural source of mentoring for colleges and universities. These alumni and their success stories are living proof that the education at any given college or university works, and that the current students are making a wise, invaluable investment in their future. Joe Lonsdale is one of countless alumni who have been tapped by their alma maters to work with promising undergraduates. Unfortunately, though, many universities seem to think that getting mentors on campus is all they need to do. There is, all too often, little oversight and few systems in place to help students when these relationships become troubled.<\/p>\n<p>Universities and colleges can\u2019t merely provide mentoring opportunities for their students. They need to monitor those relationships to ensure they are functioning productively and mutually for both the mentor and the mentee. There needs to be a system of checks and balances, if you will. Had the professor of the course who originally assigned Lonsdale to mentor Ellie Clougherty engaged in even the most basic of oversight, a great deal of suffering might have been averted. We cannot undo what has been done but universities and colleges can work to ensure that such a problematic mentoring relationship never happens again.<\/p>\n<p><em>Roxane Gay is an English professor at Purdue University and a <\/em>New York Times<em> best-selling author.

Revpar, a key measure of hotel revenue, was up nearly 7% for the year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are very optimistic about the long term,\u201d said CEO Arne Sorenson, citing numbers from the World Travel Organization that show international arrivals have more than doubled in recent years to 1.1 billion visits in 2013, as well as Marriott&#8217;s U.S. hotels reporting a 20% increase in guests coming from greater China.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s numbers like these that confirm that we are truly in a new golden age of travel,\u201d Sorenson said.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s fourth-quarter net income rose 30% from 2013, and earnings per share rose 39 percent.

A growth push.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Marriott is in a significant expansion phase. Every region inked a record number of deals last year for a total signing of 100,000 new rooms for Marriott, more than three times the pace of five years ago. The company ended 2014 with 240,000 rooms in the development pipeline, pushing toward its goal of surpassing 1 million rooms by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>The growth push is part of several initiatives under CEO Arne Sorenson, who took over for Bill Marriott in 2012 (he remains executive chairman and chairman of the board). The company is in the midst of a transformation from a number of different perspectives, a few of which Sorenson called out during the earnings call Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, all that growth poses a management and operational challenge for a company that operates 4,000 hotels in 79 countries; to be able to be more nimble, Sorenson has decentralized top management, putting in place four continental operating presidents who are closer to the local markets and regions so that decisions can be made faster and acquisition opportunities spotted sooner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Getting millennial-friendly.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The owner of the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotel brands is aggressively reengineering itself to become more relevant to millennials. That includes adding new brands to the portfolio, such as Moxy Hotels, AC Hotels by Marriott, and the Edition collection in partnership with Ian Schrager. It also means making tweaks to everything from its web presence (nearly 20% of its bookings on Marriott.com last year came from mobile devices) to its rewards program (millennials like to earn points faster) to its room design (did you know that millennials don\u2019t like to unpack their clothes into drawers?).<\/p>\n<p>Sorenson mentioned one particular point of pride on the call: the redesign of the lobby at Marriott\u2019s headquarters to be much more millennial-friendly.

The plant is being retooled to build an all-new version of the upscale Chrysler Town and Country van, which goes on sale next year as a 2017 model. But it will no longer be assembling the popular-priced sibling, the Dodge Grand Caravan, which will be discontinued after the 2015 model year.<\/p>\n<p>The demise of the Caravan, which follows the cancellation of the Plymouth Grand Voyager in 2000, represents the effective end of a vehicle style that endeared itself to Americans for three decades: the economical family hauler. Asian automakers may some day fill the gap, but earlier decisions by Ford <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"F\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/f\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">F<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and General Motors <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gm\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> to abandon the category mean that no Detroit manufacturer will be making a mass-marketed minivan.<\/p>\n<p>But the van is not going away. In fact, it is moving upscale to richer price points. The Grand Caravan stickers at $21,395; while the 2015 Town &amp; Country starts more than $8,000 higher, at $29,995. The two vans are nearly identical mechanically, but the Chrysler has more standard equipment and higher quality finishes. The bargain-priced minivan is dead; long live the luxury minivan.<\/p>\n<p>The move upmarket comes as no surprise to industry analysts, who say that Chrysler is simply responding to customer trends. Says Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at car shopping website Edmunds.com: &#8220;Just like the buyers of full-size pickup trucks, consumers buy minivans for a specific purpose and choose their vehicles very carefully. In each case, the vehicle segment has a dedicated audience and a willingness to pay more to get desired amenities. I wouldn&#8217;t expect a huge number of customers to demand pricey fully-contented minivans, but a market does exist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Chrysler explains, it is discontinuing the Grand Caravan because it wasn\u2019t making enough money, especially since two-thirds of them were going to fleet sales. &#8220;The reality is that [this] is a very difficult price point to get if you&#8217;re going to build the technology, the content, the vehicle, the platform that we want to build &#8212; and none of the competition can do it either,&#8221; Chrysler brand head Al Gardner told Automotive News. &#8220;At some point, those customers are wonderful customers for us, and we would love to be able to sell them something, but it may not be a Town and Country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The emergence of the upscale minivan represents a rare sea change in public perception. What was once avoided is now prized, even though it has become more expensive. Minivan sales peaked in the early 2000s, and market share has shrunk. The segment generated only 3.4% of the U.S. auto industry\u2019s new vehicle volume in 2014, down from 5.2% in 2007. Demand fell after demographic shifts meant the creation of fewer and smaller families. Meantime, the growing popularity of crossover SUVs, especially those with three rows of seats, gave consumers a more fashionable alternative.<\/p>\n<p>Equally significant was the social stigma that became attached to minivans early on. They were labeled as the vehicle of choice for the clich\u00e9d soccer mom, whose driving day consisted of car pools, shopping trips, and personal errands. Even when Americans were buying one million vans a year, the vehicles were shunned by car reviewers and enthusiast publications who risked offending their readership of hot rodders and boy racers.<\/p>\n<p>That attitude seems to be changing. A reviewer for the popular Jalopnik website recently took note of the convenience of sliding doors, individual captain\u2019s chairs, and flexible packaging, and concluded: \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/carbuying.jalopnik.com\/parents-just-buy-the-damn-minivan-1597502940\">A minivan is not a prison sentence<\/a>. It always amuses me when I hear men disparage minivans as though they are to be driven only by women.They are not going to handle like a Lotus, nor lay down rubber like a Challenger Hellcat [but] minivans don&#8217;t have to suck.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those manufacturers still in the minivan business (besides Chrysler, they include Honda, Toyota, and Kia) have discovered this too, and begun optioning up their vans to appeal to their selective customers. Timothy Cain at The Truth About Cars website, discovered that his borrowed Toyota Sienna Limited Premium AWD van carried a sticker price of $47,495. Upon taking a closer look, he made a list of the amenities, and discovered it included HID headlights, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear park assist sonar, power liftgate, dual sunroofs, rain-sensing wipers, navigation, driver easy speak, dual-view rear-seat entertainment, leather seating, proximity access, and heated steering wheel. Cain concluded: \u201cThere can be little argument that these versatile, capable, expansive minivans (or should we say maxivans?) offer more vehicle per dollar than any other type of modern automobile.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Automakers agree. And despite the sharp drop in sales over the past few years, they view the segment as settled now. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t invest if we didn\u2019t completely understand the segment and recognize it\u2019s very stable,\u201d Chrysler CEO Gardner was quoted as saying in told WardsAuto. \u201cIt\u2019s stable for a reason. Sliding doors and flexibility on the interior is vital to the customer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It seems that makers of premium and luxury brands have gotten the mrssage, too. At the Geneva auto show in March, BMW will show the 2 Series Gran Tourer, which features all the characteristics of a minivan except for the sliding rear doors. The car did not find much favor with enthusiasts (one called it \u201ca rolling abomination that represents everything wrong with the \u2018new\u2019 BMW going forward\u201d). BMW expects the Gran Tourer to bring more family-oriented buyers to the spinning propeller BMW brand.<\/p>\n<p>The 2 Series Gran Tourer follows by one year the introduction in Europe of the V-class van. Being derived from a commercial van, it is larger than most and is designed for efficiency rather than style. Still, Car and Driver reported that \u201cwhen fitted with the big aluminum wheels and the optional full-LED headlights, a segment first, it manages an upscale appearance.\u201d It sells in Europe for $58,000\u2014upscale indeed!\u2014and there are no plans to bring it to the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, alert spy photographers have spotted what looks like a premium Acura version of the Honda Odyssey minivan, distinguishable from its mass-market counterpart with a higher level of standard equipment, along with the Acura shield grill and jewel headlights. Honda knows minivans; it sold 122,738 Odysseys last year \u2013 the number three best-seller behind the two Chrysler vans.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1995 movie <em>Get Shorty,<\/em> Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta, goes to a rental lot to pick up the Cadillac he reserved and finds instead an Oldsmobile Silhouette \u201cdustbuster\u201d minivan. \u201cI ordered a Cadillac,\u201d he complains to the rental car attendant. \u201cOh, well,\u201d the attendant replies, \u201cYou got the Cadillac of minivans.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The line got a big laugh when the movie came out\u2014the plastic-bodied Silhouette was a bust\u2014but, going forward, Chili Palmer may in fact be able to rent a Cadillac minivan\u2014or its Japanese or German equivalent.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"10\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4066626107001-10\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066626107001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1MAZroG\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/autos_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dautomotivenews%2Cbentleysuv%2Cbentleysuv2016%2Cluxurycarmakerssuvs%2Cluxurysuv%2Cluxuryvehiclenews%2Cluxuryvehicles%2Cporchesuv%2Crollsroycesuv%2Csuvmarket%2Csuvpopularity%2Cvehiclenews%26ch%3Dautos%26topic%3Dbentleysuv&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 02:19:21","updated":"2015-02-19 02:19:21","minute":"2:19 PM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/chrysler-town-and-country\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/chrysler-town-and-country\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/chrysler-town-and-country\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"The rise of the $50,000 minivan","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ch015_004tc.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of FCA","caption":"The 2015 Chrysler Town &amp; Country.

The poll found that the health care industry severely lags\u2014except for one company: Aetna <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AET\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/aet\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AET<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>An email purportedly sent from a typical health insurance company is, for instance, four times likelier to be fraudulent than an email that claims to be from a social media company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The poor folks in health care have traditionally not had much digital interaction. They&#8217;re the ones furthest behind by a country mile,&#8221; says Patrick Peterson, Agari founder and CEO.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;state of email trust&#8221; survey, which ranks businesses based on their implementation of email security protocols, found that Aetna scored a perfect 100%. (Of the banks, Chase and Capital One also scored perfectly.) None of the other 13 health care companies surveyed even broke out of the &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; category, all falling below the middle mark. In fact, the average score for the sector was a pitiful 17%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it wasn\u2019t for Aetna the score would be half or quarter of that,&#8221; Peterson says, adding: &#8220;Anthem, quite unsurprisingly, did very poorly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In comparison, the industry with the highest ranked email security practices was social media at 67%. On the other hand, the second lowest scoring industry was European megabanks, which scored 33%.<\/p>\n<p>Each percentage presented by the survey reflects a weighted score for an industry&#8217;s or company&#8217;s email authentication practices. These consist of three standard email security protocols: Sender Policy Framework, or SPF, which checks emails against a list of authorized senders (servers approved for a given domain); DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM, which verifies the authenticity of a sender through encrypted digital signatures; and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, or DMARC, which checks emails against a published record on a company&#8217;s servers, notifies the company of any potentially spoofed emails, and rejects suspicious emails as spam. Of the three protocols, the last is the most important, Peterson says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"11\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3751418463001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3751418463001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1EsbJtM\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewnusca%2Ccomputers%2Ccyber%2Chackers%2Cplaystation%2Croberthackett%2Csecurity%2Csony%2Csybersecurity%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dtechdebate&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>DMARC, a three-year-old technology pioneered by PayPal <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EBAY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ebay\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EBAY<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\u2014which had been the most phished brand in the world for years, according to Peterson\u2014relies on an information-sharing partnership between businesses (like banks and health insurers) and email providers like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and AOL (which are a few who have so far adopted it). Whereas before such companies relied on customers to report fishy emails, now they can effectively cross-check the emails themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It gives visibility from the inbox in realtime to what criminals are trying to do in realtime to defraud customers,&#8221; says Peterson.<\/p>\n<p>Although adopting better email security practices such as these protocols would not prevent a breach like Anthem&#8217;s, they would contribute to a safer web. And if more companies opted in, the threat of phishing\u2014counterfeiting emails in order to obtain sensitive personal information from recipients\u2014would, so the idea goes, plummet.<\/p>\n<p>Email phishing continues to be a major problem. The proportion of espionage incidents incorporating targeted phishing attacks\u2014known as &#8220;spear phishing&#8221;\u2014is 67% <a href=\"\/\/\/Users\/rhackett1271\/Downloads\/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf\">according to a 2014 Verizon data breach investigations report<\/a>. Retailer Target&#8217;s breach was likely the result of a phishing attack. The FBI maintains that Sony&#8217;s breach was the result of a phishing attack. And though it is unconfirmed, Peterson and others in the security community believe Anthem&#8217;s breach was the result of a phishing attack as well.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Something that highly trained spies used to spend a great deal of time infiltrating at great risk, they&#8217;ve basically vacuumed up in one fell swoop,&#8221; Peterson said of the Anthem hackers. &#8220;In that data set of 80 million are CEOs, government officials. I think they&#8217;re going to go through and figure out espionage targets now that they have the personal information they need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aetna, the most secure health care company in terms of email according to the survey, stands out among its peers in its pursuit of best practices. &#8220;What Aetna is doing is protecting all members and consumers from receiving fraudulent email some of which is phishing attempts,&#8221; said Jim Routh, Aetna&#8217;s chief information security officer. &#8220;In our case, 60 million fraudulent emails are not going to be delivered to consumers or members this year because of DMARC,&#8221; he said, extrapolating from the number of spam emails the company has seen in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Routh, former global head of application and mobile security at J.P. Morgan, which experienced its own data breach last year, likens the process of implementing DMARC to &#8220;herding cats,&#8221; given the number of third parties that send emails on behalf of big organizations. Each third party sender has to register as a subdomain and implement the implement and enforce the authentication protocols. Routh says it cost very little to set up compared to other labor and resource-intensive initiatives\u2014like securing and monitoring every network endpoint, or training software developers to embed security controls in their products during the development process\u2014but would not divulge an exact amount.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson and Routh both agree that the reason more companies have not adopted DMARC sooner is because of a kind of corporate inertia\u2014a tendency to stick to tradition. They also believe that the people in these organizations who understand these emails protocols typically have less political clout to drive change.<\/p>\n<p>A third reason for stalling is because even when a company opts in, customers may not realize it. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like one day you say, &#8216;Oh, I didn&#8217;t get phished today!'&#8221; Routh says. &#8220;It&#8217;s more gradual, and so a consumer frankly doesn\u2019t know it.&#8221; In the long term, though, the protections afforded by DMARC may protect customer&#8217;s relationships with brands.<\/p>\n<p>Adoption of better security measures and the prosecution of high profile botmasters, among other things, have contributed to a decline in the volume of spam in the past couple years\u2014though spam still accounts for two thirds of global mail, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcafee.com\/us\/resources\/reports\/rp-quarterly-threat-q3-2014.pdf\">according to the November 2014 McAfee Labs threats report<\/a>. Still, the severity of the phishing threat is on the rise as campaigns become more highly targeted and well-crafted. And health care data is becoming more valuable, especially for nation states that can exploit it in campaigns for espionage.<\/p>\n<p>The health care industry should take a cue from Aetna. &#8220;You don\u2019t realize how much gold and treasure you have until criminals or foreign state or hacktivists get hands on it,&#8221; Peterson says.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 03:19:15","updated":"2015-02-19 03:19:15","minute":"3:19 PM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/aetna-dmarc-email-security\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/aetna-dmarc-email-security\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/aetna-dmarc-email-security\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Health companies flunked an email security survey\u2014except Aetna.

Wal-Mart is America&#8217;s largest employer, with many of its workers making the federal minimum wage or close to it. As such, the firm has been at the center of efforts to shame Corporate America into doing more to help boost workers&#8217; fortunes.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, Wal-Mart has <a href=\"http:\/\/business.time.com\/2013\/01\/16\/is-walmarts-buy-americanhire-veterans-initiative-anything-more-than-a-pr-stunt\/\">announced initiatives<\/a> aimed at helping veterans and the American manufacturing industry that sounded nice in press releases but were not necessarily effective efforts to solve national problems. But Thursday&#8217;s announcement of a minimum wage boost, and a less heralded but equally important effort to give workers more regular scheduling, is a bold move, and one that will likely help the retail giant&#8217;s workers and the company alike.<\/p>\n<p>Zeynep Ton, a professor of operations management at MIT&#8217;s Sloan School of Business, argues in her recent book <em>The Good Jobs Strategy <\/em>that retail firms have long misunderstood the value of their human resources and the benefits that can be reaped by investing more in their workforce. She writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Retailers view store labor as a cost driver, not a profit driver. And labor is not just any cost. After the cost of goods sold, labor is the largest cost for most retailers. Perhaps more important, labor is the largest controllable cost. In a pinch, retailers cannot quickly cut other large expenses such as the cost of the products they sell or their retail costs, but they can quickly and fairly easily reduce what they spend on training, benefits \u2026 or the total number of employee hours.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Not every firm, however, takes this approach. Ton studied the operations of four successful low-cost retailers: QuickTrip convenience stores, Mercadona and Trader Joe\u2019s supermarkets, and Costco to study how they managed to compete on both price <em>and <\/em>service.<\/p>\n<p>Ton&#8217;s research makes one thing quite clear: A modern retail store is an incredibly complex machine. For instance, a typical supermarket carries nearly 39,000 products, runs 100 promotions a week, and serves 2,500 customers a day. When management tries to run such an operation with poorly trained and poorly paid workers, things are bound to go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>In her book, Ton uses the example of the now-bankrupt Borders book store. She examined data from 1999 through 2002 at over 250 Borders books stores and found that its efforts to cut costs by understaffing were actually hurting the company&#8217;s sales in the long run. Tellingly, Ton found that despite heavy investment in inventory software, &#8220;one in six customers who approached a salesperson for help experienced a phantom stockout.&#8221; In other words, Borders was able to convince a customer to come into its store to buy a product, but failed to convert that sale because workers simply couldn&#8217;t find the item.<\/p>\n<p>Companies like Trader Joe&#8217;s, however, don&#8217;t suffer from these problems. Ton says full-time employees there earn anywhere from $45,000 to $60,000 per year. Trader Joe&#8217;s workers are also trained thoroughly so that they can complete a variety of tasks in the store. If fewer checkout workers are needed for a certain stretch of time, no problem\u2014the store manager can order clerks to help stock the shelves.<\/p>\n<p>Better pay also encourages workers to give better customer service and makes them less likely to leave. Indeed, the four companies Ton highlights have much lower turnover rates than the industry average, which also helps the bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>Critics of Ton&#8217;s arguments <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloombergview.com\/articles\/2013-08-27\/why-walmart-will-never-pay-like-costco\">say<\/a> that what works for Trader Joe&#8217;s or Costco may not work for everyone. Both of those stores employ fewer workers and sell far fewer products. People don&#8217;t go to a Walmart for service, but for rock bottom prices and little more. Indeed, there&#8217;s a limit to how much Wal-Mart can invest in its workforce while still competing relentlessly on prices.<\/p>\n<p>But even the critics have to admit that more and more companies, from retailers like The Gap to health insurers like Aetna, are starting to rethink the strategy of keeping wages as low as possible. That&#8217;s because workers are still a vital ingredient to any company&#8217;s success, and there is value, while admittedly difficult to measure, in keeping workers happy, motivated, and thankful for their jobs.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 01:27:16","updated":"2015-02-19 01:27:16","minute":"1:27 PM

lost their jobs<\/a> and suffered tremendous emotional distress from the vitriol unleashed in the social media world on each of them. Their \u201ccrime\u201d: some tasteless posts on Twitter or Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Around the same day that several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/opinion\/sunday\/the-epidemic-of-facelessness.html\">stories of Internet harm<\/a> surfaced, we learned that Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u2014who after being accused of assaulting a New York hotel maid was allowed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/dominique-strauss-kahn\/10144389\/Dominique-Strauss-Kahn-makes-French-parliament-comeback.html\">address the French parliament<\/a> and was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/finance\/newsbysector\/banksandfinance\/10184379\/dominique-strauss-kahn-joins-board-of-rosneft-owned-russian-bank.html\">appointed to a bank\u2019s board of directors<\/a>\u2014was about to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2015\/02\/dominique-strauss-kahn-pimping-case-unravels\/385570\/\">have charges dismissed<\/a> related to his participation in orgies involving prostitutes. At Stanford University,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/magazine\/the-stanford-undergraduate-and-the-mentor.html\"> since 1997, only 25 sexual assault or harassment cases<\/a> have made it through the university\u2019s disciplinary process, with just 10 students found culpable, only one of whom was expelled. People who post inappropriate social media posts appear to face more opprobrium than those who engage in sexual assault.<\/p>\n<p>Powerful executives and public figures often face surprisingly few consequences from actions that can cost companies billions of dollars and thousands of employees their jobs. <a href=\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2139\/ssrn.2200552\">One study of directors<\/a> found that people who had served on the boards of banks that required government assistance during the financial crisis confronted turnover imperceptibly higher than peers who had served on banks that had weathered the financial storm in better shape. <em>New York Times<\/em> columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2012\/04\/23\/tainted-but-still-serving-on-corporate-boards\/\">detailed<\/a> the many directors who maintained their positions even after presiding over financial disasters\u2014Stan O\u2019Neal, former CEO of Merrill Lynch who was on the board of Alcoa; Charles Prince of Citigroup, who was on the boards of Xerox and Johnson and Johnson; and James Johnson, the former chief executive of troubled mortgage giant Fannie Mae, who remained on the boards of Target and Goldman Sachs.<\/p>\n<p>How can we make sense of the imbalance between the severity of the punishment people face, or the lack thereof, and the damage those individuals caused or at least oversaw?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social ties and power<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Social psychology teaches us that we tend to like people (and things) that <a href=\"http:\/\/cdp.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/2\/106.short\">remind us of ourselves<\/a>. We bond more quickly and closely with strangers who mimic our words, intonations, and behaviors, creating a <a href=\"http:\/\/nytimes.com\/2008\/02\/12\/health\/12mimic.html?_r=0\">\u201ccurrent of good will between two people.\u201d<\/a> We are more likely to <a href=\"http:\/\/psp.sage.pub.com\/content\/30\/1\/35.short\">do favors for strangers who share even incidental similarities<\/a>, such as birthdays, fingerprint patterns, personality scores, or first names, all of which create a \u201cunit relationship,\u201d a sense of association and shared social identity.<\/p>\n<p>These facts make organizational self-regulation inherently problematic. Stanford enforces its standards through a <a href=\"http:\/\/studentaffairs.stanford.edu\/communitystandards\/about\/board\">board of judicial affairs<\/a> that consists of 15 people drawn from faculty, staff, and students, an arrangement typical across universities. Boards of directors share social ties and experiences, and are likely to see board members even from other companies as somewhat similar. Expecting harsh punishment and sanctions from others who share social identities and affiliations flies in the face of what we know about interpersonal behavior\u2014and unsurprisingly, harsh sanctions are rare in these cases.<\/p>\n<p>We also know that people like to <a href=\"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/psp\/34\/3\/366\/\">\u201cbask in reflected glory,\u201d<\/a> to identify and be associated with winners, with the powerful, with rich and successful people or organizations. Consequently, we are more likely to make excuses for the powerful, or at least excuse our continued association with them, almost regardless of their behavior. When Dominique Strauss-Kahn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/dominique-strauss-kahn-10144399\/dominique-strauss-kahn-makes-french-parliament-comeback.html\">appeared before the French parliament<\/a>, one senator said, \u201cHis intellectual qualities are not at stake. We lack very good specialists on banks and tax evasion on the international level.\u201d Almost inevitably, standards and sanctions differ depending on the power of the accused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fairly enforcing norms and standards<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, how do we develop processes that ensure that sanctions are more aligned with the severity of the harm someone inflicts?<\/p>\n<p>First, we might try something that few people seem to do these days\u2014ask how much harm a particular action has caused. If the behavior is tasteless but largely harmless, then instead of mounting some social media screed, leave the person alone. Unfocused, misdirected, and disproportionate anger isn\u2019t good for anyone.<\/p>\n<p>Second, because people are unlikely to take stern action against those who are like them, we should turn to outsiders who possess objectivity and don\u2019t have social ties or similarity to the people accused. In the American judicial system, people are judged by juries of their peers, not juries of their friends or others who share social identities, such as employers, with them\u2014and for good reason. The lack of quasi-judicial proceedings involving independent judges on college campuses and in corporate boardrooms makes it much harder to properly mete out punishments.<\/p>\n<p>Third, because we know that there is a bias that favors the powerful, producing justice requires measures to redress this predisposition. One step might be to acknowledge and remind observers of the psychological factors that favor the powerful as a means to inoculate against this tendency. Another step would be to, in more formal proceedings, limit the powerful individuals\u2019 display of the accoutrements of their power.<\/p>\n<p>A fourth solution derives from the well-known <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/opinion\/sunday\/the-epidemic-of-facelessness.html\">Gyges effect, the \u201cdisinhibition created by communications over the distances of the Internet,\u201d<\/a> of having people being able to comment on and make judgments of others anonymously. When people are accountable for their judgments and actions, they are more likely to behave responsibly. I have advocated that academic journal reviewers be identified and identifiable after the fact for precisely this reason. We need and deserve to know who sits in judgment.<\/p>\n<p>None of these solutions is a panacea. But the disproportionate responses\u2014both too much and too little punishment for infractions large and small\u2014suggest we need to pay much more attention to this issue.<\/p>\n<p><em>Jeffrey Pfeffer is Thomas D.

Starting in the early 2000s, China made a lofty goal to leapfrog the West in automotive technology by becoming a world leader in electric cars. The government declared it would have around 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2011. That didn\u2019t happen. In fact, China sold fewer than 6,000 that year. Even as electric vehicle sales have swelled in America and Japan, China\u2019s attempt to surpass the U.S. in automotive technology has sputtered.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Until recently, China\u2019s lagging electric vehicle industry stood in sharp contrast to its overall auto industry. From 2000 through 2014, China\u2019s auto market expanded at an astonishing rate. In 2000, the country produced fewer passenger cars than Spain \u2013 about 2 million, according to statistics from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. However, China\u2019s Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported last month that 2014 automotive sales surpassed 23 million \u2013 making China by far the largest auto market in the world. In 2011, the World Bank estimated <i>per capita<\/i> vehicle ownership in China at only 69 per thousand people, compared to about 800 per thousand people in the U.S. So China\u2019s industry has significant room for growth.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The rise of China\u2019s auto industry has been fueled by foreign investment, oil and technology \u2013 and it has brought with it a suffocating smog epidemic in China\u2019s largest cities that is driving away wealthy Chinese and foreign expats. China\u2019s Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang has long been working on a plan to replace foreign energy, innovation and capital with domestic resources. He is a former Audi engineer and over more than a decade, his goal has been to overtake the West in automotive technology by pushing China past the era of internal combustion engines and toward electric vehicles \u2013 thus setting the stage for China to dominate the $2 trillion-plus global auto market. Wan Gang also sees electric vehicles as one partial solution to China\u2019s sooty air.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">My book, <i>The Great Race: The Global Quest for the Car of the Future,<\/i> tells how up until recently that project has been a series of ambitious failures. As late as January 2014, China was selling only about 600 electric cars per month \u2013 that same month the U.S. sold over 6,000.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But during the last four months of 2014, China\u2019s electric vehicle sales skyrocketed. In December alone, monthly sales of passenger and commercial electric vehicles hit 27,000. According to data from the China Automotive Technology Research Center and the Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, sales of electric cars in China surpassed sales of electric cars in the U.S. for the first time. In fact, China\u2019s electric vehicle sales in December 2014 were almost 30 times higher than January 2014 sales.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Many analysts say that the last four months of 2014 will be remembered as the stretch when China\u2019s electric vehicle market finally turned a corner. If this growth continues, China may surpass the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles in 2015.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">All this raises a number of questions: First, are these sales figures reliable? Statistics on China\u2019s automotive market are often vague and unreliable. But statistics from the China Automotive Technology Research Center \u2013 a massive technical body responsible for everything from crash testing to vehicle battery standards \u2014 tend to be good. Some would say they are the gold standard in Chinese automotive data. The website <a href=\"http:\/\/ev-sales.blogspot.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">EV-sales.blogspot.com<\/span><\/a> essentially confirmed the 2014 numbers \u2013 supported by sales numbers for individual models. EV-salesblogspot.com reported that Tesla was outsold by five domestic manufacturers in China: BYD, Kandi, Chery Zotye and BAIC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That leads to a second question: why are sales booming? An analyst from the China Automotive Technology Research Center attributed the jump to the elimination of the vehicle tax on Chinese electric vehicles (until September 2014, buyers were taxed at 10% of the purchase price). But is it really possible that lifting a 10% tax could cause such a massive surge in sales? Perhaps. Policy-led price adjustments have sometimes had spectacular results in China\u2019s auto market. For instance, when the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it lowered import tariffs on foreign automobiles. That year, China\u2019s auto market grew by 37%, as some domestic producers were forced to lower prices to remain competitive. When Chinese automaker First Automotive Works Tianjin reduced its sticker price for one model by 20%, sales shot up 900%, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/mams.rmit.edu.au\/iakd0nbpx54i.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">one study on the Chinese auto market<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">More recently, when China\u2019s auto market started to slow in February 2008 \u2013 together with the rest of the world \u2013 the country sought to stimulate automotive sales and encourage its citizens to buy cleaner cars by cutting taxes on small displacement gasoline engines. In March, 2008 the central government cut taxes on these small cars to 5% from 10%. Auto sales jumped by 22% in April, and grew by 49% annually in 2009. That <span class=\"s1\">was the <\/span>year China became the largest auto market in the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s still far from clear what factors are driving China\u2019s recent electric vehicle boom \u2013 and why Tesla was left out. It\u2019s possible that year-end government procurement led to unusually strong numbers in December. Another possibility is that China\u2019s policies to promote electric vehicles have finally reached a tipping point. For instance, to deal with traffic congestion in major Chinese cities, many municipal governments \u2013 including Beijing \u2013 have limited the number of new vehicle registrations. In Beijing, electric vehicles are exempt from this quota system. <span class=\"s1\"> The central government <\/span>has also instituted a new set of policies to encourage competition among domestic manufacturers \u2014 <span class=\"s1\">competitive pressure <\/span>that was woefully lacking during the early years of China\u2019s electric vehicle program. Perhaps locally produced vehicles have finally reached a quality threshold that make them attractive to Chinese buyers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Whatever the reason, just as China\u2019s electric vehicle market is taking off, Tesla is facing new competitive challenges at home and abroad. Traditional automakers like BMW, Volkswagen <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VOW3\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/vow3\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VOW3<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>and General Motors <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gm\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> are developing electric vehicles that are faster, cheaper, and boast better range than before. In fact, in October 2014, Volkswagen\u2019s CEO Jochem Heizmann announced the company was developing more than 20 electric vehicles for the Chinese market. Then there is also the prospect of competition from newcomers like tech giant Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/aapl\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> \u2013 which is hiring away Tesla\u2019s engineers for princely sums and is rumored to be developing its own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/02\/apple-making-car-isnt-ridiculous-think\/\"><span class=\"s3\">electric car<\/span><\/a>. At the same time, Tesla is struggling to establish its brand in the world\u2019s key emerging market at what may be a critical inflection point. That is a huge problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Perhaps that explains why Musk is losing his cool over weak China sales. Up until recently, China has been an underperforming electric vehicle market, and Tesla has been an over-achieving electric vehicle company.

Store visits, ostensibly intended as intelligence-gathering missions, were meticulously planned affairs, only slightly less formal than, say, a presidential visit. Every relevant national manager and local functionary would be notified in advance, each step choreographed, the \u201cregular shoppers\u201d handpicked and vetted. About the only thing missing was a brass band playing \u201cHail to the Chief.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">But on a mid-October day, just two months after he took the helm, Cornell took an unannounced detour from a business trip to Dallas. A friend connected him with an assortment of seven local moms, each of them loyal Target customers. Unrecognized by store workers, Cornell deployed each member of his ad hoc focus group to the department she frequented most\u2014clothing, housewares, or groceries, for example\u2014then waited for their reports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">What Cornell sacrificed in pomp and circumstance, he made for up in candid opinions. The shoppers had a bevy of comments and complaints. Two Latina mothers criticized the bland colors and general drabness of Target\u2019s apparel. The younger moms told him that they buy only organic food for their babies; they wanted greater selection. By the end of his two hours in the store, Cornell had some germs of what only a few months later, as we\u2019ll see, are significant changes he is planning.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-7\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"7\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It may seem like a small step. But Cornell is the first Target CEO to be recruited from outside the company, and fittingly, he is already bringing a jolt of fresh energy to the country\u2019s third-largest retailer (behind only Wal-Mart and Costco). \u201cI got such great, genuine feedback from them,\u201d Cornell says of the Dallas visit. As he puts it, providing advance warning ensures stores are \u201cgoing to be beautiful\u2014but it\u2019s not reality.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar1-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-997604\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar1-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=328\" alt=\"TAR1-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"328\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A firm grip on reality is only the beginning of what Target needs today. A company that became a national phenomenon with retail alchemy\u2014a rare ability to attract millions with hip designer items at clear-out prices\u2014has seen that delicate formula stifled by excessive caution and a strangling bureaucracy, even as competitors emulated Target\u2019s approach, and fast-fashion retailers like H&amp;M, off-price chains such as T.J. Maxx, and dollar stores all muscled onto its turf. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"25\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4066900744001-25\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066900744001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1EpgoN0\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dbriancornell%2Cphilwahba%2Ctarget%2Ctargetcorporation%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dtarget&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p class=\"p2\">Instead of cultivating its cachet as competition mounted and the economy <span class=\"s3\">struggled, Target instead emphasized low prices and unimaginative products.<br \/>\n<\/span>The doubly deadly result: The retailer is no longer winning on style <i>or<\/i> on price.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Target is drawing fewer shoppers. As of December, 37% of Americans had browsed in a Target store or its website in the preceding four weeks, according to data from Kantar Retail. In December 2007 the equivalent figure was 53%. That means millions of shoppers have abandoned Target. Despite the exodus, sales have ticked up during the past few years; Target is on track for $73 billion in 2014. What that means is that the company has become increasingly reliant on its core customers. It needs to attract fresh ones if it wants to reignite its growth.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then there\u2019s the value equation. In December 2007, Target scored a 48.4 on a scale that measures shoppers\u2019 sense that they get their money\u2019s worth, as compiled by YouGov BrandIndex. As of January 2015, that number had plunged to 31, erasing the company\u2019s long-standing edge over rival Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-8\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"8\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Those are the disconcerting trends for the long term. Then there were the <\/span>company\u2019s straight-up whiffs. A massive hacking in 2013 enraged customers. The company\u2019s subpar web presence left it gasping to catch its rivals. And finally it bungled its expansion into Canada in disastrous fashion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That array of woes has steadily chipped away at Target\u2019s profits. Earnings, which peaked at $3.2 billion a decade ago, are expected to be $1.5 billion for 2014. Net income as a percentage of sales has fallen from 4.5% to 2% during the same period, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ, and gross profit margins have slipped.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s the situation facing Cornell. A former senior PepsiCo executive and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, he has made a name for himself in the retail world with a seemingly contradictory set of traits: He\u2019s a dyed-in-the-wool data guy who likes nothing more than nosing around a store and getting a feel for what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar2-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-997612\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar2-03-01-15.jpeg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=392\" alt=\"TAR2-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"392\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Since taking the reins in August, Cornell, 55, has moved quickly, seeking to speed up Target\u2019s metabolism. He aggressively squeezed Amazon and Wal-Mart by offering free shipping for online orders during the holidays. That decision was made in a matter of days rather than the months it would have taken in the past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The new CEO\u2019s most dramatic step so far: He ripped the bandage off Target\u2019s Canadian wound, a failed 2013 initiative that left the company bleeding. Closing all its stores north of the border cost $5.4 billion, but it stanched a key source of losses and will help the company concentrate on its U.S. business. Cornell\u2019s decisiveness, along with a better-than-expected holiday-season increase in sales at the website and stores open for at least a year, has revived Target\u2019s stock: The shares have jumped 30% under the new CEO, to all-time highs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell knows the plight of retailers that can\u2019t adapt, and he\u2019s the first to acknowledge that Target has a lot of work ahead. A key element will be improving the company\u2019s focus, which is CEO-speak for exiting or paring back certain business lines. \u201cThe categories we\u2019re going to stand for,\u201d he says, \u201cthe ones I call our signature categories\u2014they\u2019re the ones that can differentiate the brand going forward. So you\u2019ll see us elevate our focus around our style categories, apparel, home, beauty\u2014critically important categories for our guest\u2014and we think we can differentiate in that space.\u201d He also wants to \u201clocalize\u201d Target\u2019s product mix. The company plans to follow its customers as they move back to cities, with new urban locations that are smaller than its 1,800 big boxes, and stop playing catch-up when it comes to digital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-9\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"9\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Most of all, Target knows it needs to recapture its elusive ability to seduce. But as many a retailer (and many a teenager) has learned the hard way, wanting to be cool is a lot easier than actually being cool.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Up by his bootstraps&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">W<\/span><span class=\"s4\">hen Cornell arrived<\/span><b> <\/b>at Target\u2019s headquarters in Minneapolis, he was installed in the newly redone CEO\u2019s corner suite on the 26th floor. Almost immediately he insisted he be moved to a smaller office down the hall that is only steps away from the company\u2019s global data nerve center.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_81.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-996600\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_81.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=576\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">T<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">The data-monitoring hub at Target\u2019s headquarters<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Grab from Fortune Video<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s the company\u2019s mission-control-style monitoring room, which it calls \u201cguest central.\u201d There a team of 10 staffers scrutinizes live feeds from social media sites such as Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter, along with television stations, on nine large TV screens high on the wall. They watch intently and use software to aggregate data to gauge by-the-second reactions to a product launch or news<br \/>\nannouncement or to respond quickly to, say, a customer fulminating on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The social command center existed before Cornell became CEO. But he has beefed up its capabilities, and he\u2019s looking for creative ways to use the data. He drops in every morning and insists on two updates a day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Analytics have long been a central part of Cornell\u2019s approach. When he headed <span class=\"s3\">Sam\u2019s Club, the $55-billion-a-year Wal-Mart division, from 2009 to 2012,<br \/>\n<\/span>he improved the unit\u2019s customer-insights system, according to Maggie Nation, <span class=\"s3\">a marketing executive at Sam\u2019s under Cornell. The effort yielded such good results <\/span>that Wal-Mart had all of its insights teams report directly to Cornell.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell had previously upgraded analytics at Safeway, where he was chief marketing officer from 2004 to 2007. That data helped him ramp up the grocer\u2019s successful Lifestyle stores and led him to add higher-end touches like softer lighting, hardwood floors, and sushi bars. Cornell also loved to walk around stores, says Stuart Aitken, who worked under him at two companies. Cornell would grill customers about such minutiae as store lighting and which signs were hard to read. He would often take the clues he gathered in those conversations and use the analytics to look for broader patterns that would reveal problems or opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-10\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"10\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Cornell\u2019s emphasis on analytics <\/span>appealed to Target\u2019s board as it looked for a new CEO, according to the director who oversaw the search, Roxanne Austin, head of Austin Investment Advisors, a private investment and consulting firm. Cornell also boasted a track record of <span class=\"s2\">building private-label brands, a priority for Target, and had a reputation as a leader<\/span> who could rally the troops and change a culture. All of that trumped his inexperience in three areas that will be crucial to determining whether Target can get its mojo back: home goods, e-commerce, and clothing. (Cornell is trying to catch up: He was the first Target CEO to hobnob at New York Fashion Week in September.) \u201cNo one else had this set of experiences,\u201d Austin says. \u201cHe was the perfect guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">B<\/span><span class=\"s4\">rian Cornell\u2019s childhood<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> was anything but perfect\u2014or easy. His parents split up early, and Cornell was only 6 when he last saw his father, who died young. Cornell\u2019s mother suffered from heart disease through much of her life, and the two of them lived very modestly off her disability check in working-class White-stone, Queens. Eventually his mother\u2019s health declined to the point that Cornell\u2019s grandparents became his main caregivers. From the age that he could first make himself useful, Cornell says, he did odd jobs in his spare time: shoveling snow, mowing lawns, stacking bricks. \u201cI always had to work to fill in the gaps,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">As a teenager he spent summers cleaning trucks at a Tropicana distribution center near his home. Other retail jobs, along with gigs coaching high school football, helped him pay his way through college at UCLA. (Among the few objects displayed in Cornell\u2019s spare, immaculate office is an autographed UCLA football helmet from fellow alum and Dallas Cowboys legend Troy Aikman inscribed \u201cFrom one QB to another.\u201d) <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI had to scramble and scratch for everything I have,\u201d says Cornell. Even today, he says, \u201cI probably still wake up every day wanting to make sure I don\u2019t end up battling some of those same things I did when I was a kid,\u201d and adds, \u201cI\u2019m still my toughest critic.\u201d Despite all that, Cornell is approachable and genial, though he listens with an intensity that is almost alarming.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cIntense\u201d also applies to Cornell\u2019s workout regimen. It\u2019s not rare that a CEO would be found every morning at 7 a.m., as Cornell is, in the gym at company headquarters, on the treadmill as he fires off emails from his iPad. What\u2019s unusual is that on most days he returns to the gym for a second session after work. About <span class=\"s3\">15 years ago Cornell attended the \u201ccorporate athlete program\u201d at the Human <\/span>Performance Institute, making him a zealot for optimizing performance not only with exercise but also with adequate sleep.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cornell isn\u2019t the type who exalts the machismo of outlandish hours. Just the opposite. It\u2019s not unusual for him to inquire about a colleague\u2019s workout habits and make specific recommendations. Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of PepsiCo Latin America Foods, says his former boss would gently chide him to shoot for 200 minutes of exercise a week, extolling the sound mind he said stems from a sound body. He says Cornell encouraged him to take time for fitness on their business trips.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_3-resized.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-996294\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_3-resized.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=1469\" alt=\"Brian Cornell, CEO of Target\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1469\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">Cornell with designs from Target&#8217;s forthcoming collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell was always ambitious. But from the outside, he looked like a corporate lifer, spending 20 years ascending inside Tropicana and then its subsequent owner, PepsiCo. But his<br \/>\nimpatience to land a major CEO position eventually set him in motion. He began hopscotching through a series of senior positions at different companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell worked at Safeway from 2004 to 2007 as chief of marketing, as CEO of Michaels Stores from 2007 to 2009, then as CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. At each stop he expanded the chain\u2019s house brands. At Sam\u2019s Club, Cornell helped reverse a sales decline and made it the fastest-growing division of Wal-Mart. Cornell was briefly viewed as a contender to succeed Mike Duke but left in part because his wife never cottoned to life in Bentonville, Ark. \u2009Cornell returned to PepsiCo in 2012 to head the Americas operations for Frito-Lay and other foods. He was whispered about as a potential PepsiCo CEO. But when Target called, he didn\u2019t hesitate. As he puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s a dream job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;The rise of cheap chic&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">T<\/span><span class=\"s4\">arget\u2019s history turns <\/span><span class=\"s2\">on two well-timed decisions. The first was the realization by Dayton\u2019s department store that customers were flocking to the less expensive wares it was selling in its basement. That was the genesis of Target, in 1962, a year that also saw the birth of Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Kohl\u2019s. Wal-Mart in particular would cast a shadow over its smaller rival. By the late 1980s its low prices were squeezing Target. That led to the second crucial decision, in the mid-1990s. Target could set itself apart by offering something its rivals didn\u2019t: clothing and kitchenware with panache and low prices. (Excellent marketing didn\u2019t hurt either.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-11\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"11\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By 1999, Target had attained a chic that was nearly inconceivable for a discounter. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">It launched the first of what have so far been 150 collaborations with leading <\/span>designers, offering teakettles by renowned architect Michael Graves. Later collections, with Isaac Mizrahi in 2002 and Italian fashion house Missoni in 2011, were smashes, too, and established such offerings as Target\u2019s signature strategy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Great Recession threw the company off its stride. Being trendy seemed like an indulgence in a time of depressed wages and underemployment. Target\u2019s marketing began echoing Wal-Mart\u2019s dogma of frugal prices rather than fun and flair. Target cut back the shelf space it was devoting to unique, unproven merchandise\u2014whether it was home goods or clothing\u2014and reduced the quality of some of its apparel to keep costs down. Meanwhile, Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s, and H&amp;M were imitating the company with their own designer collaborations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Target was standing out less and less. To generate visits the company added more groceries, but without any distinctive touch to set it apart. By 2013 food, a notoriously low-margin business, had grown to a fifth of its revenue. Target had concentrated too much on the \u201cpay less\u201d part of its mantra and not enough on the \u201cexpect more\u201d part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_7.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-994741\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_7.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=958&#038;h=650\" alt=\"Target Canada\" width=\"958\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">A Target in Toronto in February, weeks after the company announced it was pulling out of Canada.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Darren Calabrese \u2014 The Canadian Press\/AP<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Then came two epic corporate wipe-outs. Target\u2019s move into Canada was <\/span>a fiasco. Rather than launching new <span class=\"s2\">stores in carefully selected spots and building slowly, Target acquired 124 locations in 2013 in one fell swoop by buying all the outlets from a defunct discounter called Zellers. Never mind that one of the causes of Zellers\u2019 demise was the poor location of its stores. Or that the spaces were designed to enable a different strategy from Target\u2019s. Throw in supply-chain problems that yielded empty shelves and high prices, and it <\/span>added up to an unmitigated disaster.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then there was a second calamity. In the final days of the 2013 holiday shopping season, Target disclosed <span class=\"s2\">that hackers had obtained as many as 70 million customer records. Though such intrusions seem to occur almost daily today, at the time it was the worst retail hacking in history. Customers were livid. They punished Target, and business slowed well into 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By that spring the pressure had built, and something had to give. As often happens, it was the chief executive who gave. In May 2014, Gregg Steinhafel, a superb merchandiser who\u2019d been integral to Target\u2019s rise but stiff and cautious as CEO, resigned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Corporate soul-searching&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">W<\/span><span class=\"s4\">hile the confluence<b> <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\">of the data breach, the Canadian disaster, and Steinhafel\u2019s departure was traumatic, it may have been the shock Target needed. CFO John Mulligan, who was named interim CEO, started a four-month corporate soul-searching effort. \u201cThe truth is, we haven\u2019t kept up,\u201d Mulligan told staff in an email on May 6, the day after Steinhafel left. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight harder to give our guests what they want.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Target intensified efforts to improve its second-rate website. Its capabilities had fallen behind those of Wal-Mart, which had the capacity to use a big chunk of its stores to help fill online orders a year before Target did. The company rewrote three-quarters of the code for its website and has now caught up to, or even surpassed, some rivals. Target\u2019s Cartwheel coupon-tracking app is now considered an industry leader, downloaded 13 million times, and has generated $1 billion in sales so far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Under Mulligan, Target took symbolic yet practical steps, such as consolidating its top executives on the 26th floor of its headquarters to make it easier to talk to one another. Target relaxed its dress code last March, elating the staff by leaving sartorial decisions largely to common sense. (Even in the company\u2019s most formal days, there was a standing exemption for any shirt in Target\u2019s signature red worn with khakis.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-12\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"12\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell has loosened the atmosphere in other ways. He eats in the company cafeteria, where he mingles with staff. He opened Target\u2019s annual fall meeting to the press for the first time. The company has set up a lounge on the executive floor where employees can check out what merchandise is in the pipeline and swap ideas in a relaxed environment. And the company, long populated by lifers, is redoubling efforts to recruit outsiders with fresh ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cIt\u2019s not that we <i>became<\/i> insular. We <i>were<\/i> insular,\u201d says Jeff Jones, Target\u2019s marketing boss. \u201cIf you need to go faster, you need people who\u2019ve done it. We didn\u2019t have enough people who\u2019d done it before.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell certainly qualifies as an outsider, and his resolution of the Canada question showed the speed of his decision-making. The fate of the operations was sealed when the CEO made a solo journey to some Montreal-area stores the Saturday before Christmas, the busiest day of the season in retail. As Cornell wandered among the empty aisles, he peppered his CFO with texts. He concluded that painful as it was to admit, it would take too much time and treasure to fix the Canadian operation. Less than three weeks later Target announced it was shuttering all its stores there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_4.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-994738\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_4.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=975&#038;h=650\" alt=\"CEO of Target Brian Cornell\" width=\"975\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"caption\">Cornell examines a new housewares display.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[story-section title=&#8221;Three years or bust&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">I<\/span><span class=\"s1\">t\u2019s early February <\/span>and Cornell is back in a Target again. As he strides through its outlet in northeast Minneapolis, which doubles as its \u201cliving lab,\u201d he points out how Target is displaying its kitchenware. Rather than plates, mats, and utensils stocked separately, they are presented together in realistic kitchen and table settings. The idea is to help customers imagine mixing and matching items in the way that countless retailers have been doing for decades.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">It seems symbolic. The CEO is a whirl of ideas and initiatives, but most of them appear incremental and one or another of its rivals has some version of most of them. For example, Target is trying out a new \u201cfirst impressions\u201d area at the front of a few stores, looking to highlight choice items, such as an elegant soup bowl, in an appealing presentation. It would be a step up from the bins with $1 tchotchkes that currently welcome shoppers. And Target is taking electronics like iPads out of glass cases so that customers can try them out. (One plan that seems more unusual: Target is testing a service in which a brand-agnostic staffer will offer advice to parents of infants. The baby and maternity category is essential to capturing the next generation of shoppers, he says, and defines a group that visits Target stores most often.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Cornell acknowledges that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we\u2019re talking about where someone\u2019s going to say, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u2019\u2009\u201d But, he says, \u201cfrom a Target standpoint, they\u2019ve never seen us bundle these key initiatives.\u201d And, he argues, \u201cthey will add up to a very bold change for the brand and the business\u2009\u2026\u2009If we execute the plan over the next few years, you will say, \u2018Boy, Target made a huge transformation.\u2019\u2009\u201d He\u2019s giving himself and his team three years to deliver.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_5-copy.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Target Express\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">The first TargetExpress in Minneapolis with food on display.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The CEO plans to focus on categories in which Target believes it can win and trim elsewhere. (In February, for example, he pulled the plug on Target\u2019s video-streaming service.) That means more store brands. Cornell\u2019s Safeway experience is instructive. Early to see the opportunity in organic foods, he was the architect of the grocer\u2019s O Organics brand, which took off. Today, mere months after the moms in the Dallas store told him they wanted more organic foods for their babies, Cornell has a goal: He wants organic items to account for 60% of the company\u2019s baby food sales within two years, up from 40% now. That would address a key challenge: to make Target\u2019s food selection more distinctive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Cornell is likely to accelerate Target\u2019s roll out of its smaller outlets, such as its 100,000-square-foot CityTarget stores aimed at urban consumers. The company is also experimenting with highly customized 20,000-square-foot TargetExpress neighborhood mini-stores, the second of which will open next month in the Bay Area. Of course, Wal-Mart already has 700 small-format (primarily grocery) stores. Walgreens now sells fresh food in many stores, and even Family Dollar is improving its selection. And outside of the food aisles, other retailers and department stores are still on the hunt for the hip-and-cheap sweet spot.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-996185-13\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"13\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So is Cornell. In November, Target collaborated with Story, a trendy boutique in New York City\u2019s Chelsea that creates a new theme every month and changes the look and merchandise accordingly. Just six weeks elapsed from the time Cornell first showed up at Story in September, introducing himself as \u201cBrian from Target,\u201d to the opening. In the old days that would\u2019ve taken many months. Story spotlighted Target brands like Archer Farms, as well as some exclusive products by TOMS and Nate Berkus. It was a way for Target, and Cornell, to keep a finger on the pulse of what\u2019s cool.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Should the CEO personally be leading the search for the next hit teakettle? Maybe not. The company may or may not succeed at luring new customers. But Cornell will surely be one of the first to know. He\u2019ll be in the aisles, finding out for himself.\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>More from Fortune:<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:red;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/15\/target-canada-fail\/\">Why Target failed in Canada<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:red;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/02\/target-express\/\">Target taking its small Express stores to more markets<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 08:00:23","updated":"2015-02-19 08:00:23","minute":"8:00 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/target-new-ceo\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tar03_21.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune","caption":"Brian Cornell with Bullseye at Target\u2019s \u201cliving lab\u201d in northeast Minneapolis","attach_id":"996590"},"excerpt":"","authors":[{"id":"345187","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/phil-wahba\/","name":"Phil Wahba","twitter":"philwahba","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"55\" height=\"55\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/twitter_wahba.jpg?quality=80&amp;w=55\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"PHIL WAHBA\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/twitter_wahba.jpg?quality=80&w=55",55,55,false],"bio":"Phil Wahba is a writer for Fortune","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Photograph by Ackerman + Gruber for Fortune The Target executives were taken aback.

It is unclear what the fallout would be if Greece were to impose capital controls and leave the euro, but it seems that Germany and the ECB just don&#8217;t care anymore.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Greece&#8217;s new left-wing government blinked on Thursday morning in its month-long standoff with its eurozone partners, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/02\/19\/eurozone-greece-request-idUSL5N0VT2S720150219\"><span class=\"s1\">saying<\/span><\/a> that it would agree to a six-month extension of the expiring bailout agreement at its current terms so that the two sides could have more time to negotiate. It was a typical &#8220;kick the can down the road&#8221; move we have come to expect from EU officials, something that Greece&#8217;s new government promised it wouldn&#8217;t do just a couple days earlier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The markets rallied on the news, with Greek bank stocks shooting up 10% and Greek 10-year bonds yields falling back to the single digits. The so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/256125514\/Greek-Finance-Min-presentations-at-Eurogroup-11-15-Feb-2015#download\"><span class=\"s1\">radical<\/span><\/a>&#8221; Greek government finally fell in line with the status quo, and that itself was enough for the market to chill out and hobble onward.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But in a shocking turn of events, Germany&#8217;s finance ministry rejected the Greek proposal, saying that it amounted to a bridge financing deal that didn&#8217;t propose any &#8220;substantial&#8221; solutions to the problem at hand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, what has changed? Did Germany truly expect a real solution to this issue? Or was the finance ministry just pretending to play hardball to save face with the German public? This wouldn&#8217;t be the first time for Germany to claim it was calling Greece&#8217;s bluff and then fall apart at the end of the day. It has happened pretty much every time Germany has negotiated a bailout deal since the eurozone debt crisis began in 2009.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this time could be different. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.faz.net\/aktuell\/wirtschaft\/eurokrise\/griechenland\/notenbanker-verlieren-den-glauben-an-griechenland-ezb-verhandelt-ueber-ela-kredite-13436284.html\"><span class=\"s1\">report<\/span><\/a> in German newspaper <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung<\/em> quotes an unnamed central banker from the ECB who believes that the Grexit may now be inevitable. &#8220;One gets the impression that the Greeks want to get out [of the euro] and are just looking for an escape goat,&#8221; at this point, the unnamed central banker told the paper.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This comes a couple weeks after the ECB <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/06\/greece-germany-eurozone-fate\/\"><span class=\"s1\">abruptly<\/span><\/a> stopped taking Greek sovereign bonds from Greek banks as collateral for low-cost loans to fund their operations. The ECB had been loaning the banks money and accepting the junk Greek debt at face value even though it was worth a fraction of that amount in the real world, something that, naturally, angered Germany.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ECB pulled this cheap financing as Greeks were pulling money out of the their banks amid growing fear of a Grexit, when the Greek banks needed the money the most. The Greek banks were forced to turn to their own central bank for cash, which also borrows from the ECB, but at a higher interest rate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All this has accelerated the run on the Greek banks, forcing the Greek Central Bank to borrow at a frenetic pace from the ECB to make sure they have enough cash on hand to meet demand. But there is a limit to how much the Greek Central Bank can borrow from the ECB, 65 billion euros, and it appears that they just hit the ceiling. The Greeks reportedly asked the ECB to increase their line of credit by 10 billion euros, but the ECB agreed in an emergency meeting overnight that it would only increase it by 3 billion euros.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ECB knows very well that money buys the Greek banks a week, two weeks tops. The Greek banks won&#8217;t need the money if the panic stops, but that won&#8217;t happen unless Germany relents and agrees to Greece&#8217;s demand for leniency. With Germany saying <em>N<\/em><i>ein<\/i> today just to extend talks without granting any concessions, it is now clear that the whole situation may actually blow up this time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Greece will then have to make a tough choice. They will either need to accept total defeat and continue on with the terms of the bailout agreement, which would probably result in a Greek default in a few months time, or they can institute capital controls (which would restrict people&#8217;s ability to withdraw cash), default on the bailout now, and leave the euro.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Will the Grexit cause the euro to fall apart? Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, famously promised that he would do &#8220;whatever it takes &#8221; to save the euro, so a Grexit may not automatically mean the end of the currency union. He has been preparing for years to counter the backlash that would follow a Grexit, most recently by announcing a multi-billion euro quantitative easing program that could stabilize the bond yields of EU countries if they explode post-Grexit. Will it be enough? No one knows for sure.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Greece, neither of its option seems acceptable at this point. For some reason, Greeks overwhelmingly want to stay in the euro, which is why the Greek government swallowed its pride and agreed to kick the can down the road. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the current head of the Euro group negotiations with Greece, called for a fourth &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; meeting tomorrow of finance ministers to discuss the Greek plan. While Dijsselbloem is somewhat hopeful that a deal can be struck\u2014he said at the last meeting that he wouldn&#8217;t call another unless he thought a deal was close\u2014it will be impossible to strike an agreement without German backing, meaning a Grexit could be just around the corner.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 02:30:07","updated":"2015-02-19 02:30:07","minute":"2:30 PM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/germany-greece-euro-zone\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Germany may have just put the nail in Greece's Euro zone coffin","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"26\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4069505142001-26\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4069505142001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/17hIAGS\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Decb%2Ceuro%2Cgreece%2Cgrexit%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dgreece&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>In a shocking turn of events, Germany&#8217;s finance ministry rejected Greek&#8217;s request for an extension to its expiring bailout agreement.

Just last week, the New York Times published an article about a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/magazine\/the-stanford-undergraduate-and-the-mentor.html?_r=0\">female Stanford computer science major\u2019s allegations <\/a>of abuse by her mentor and former boyfriend (allegations he denied). What is it like to be a female computer science major at Stanford in 2015? Fortune asked Lea Coligado, Stanford \u201816, to share her experiences.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When I first came to Stanford in the fall of 2012, Computer Science was the last thing on my mind. I hail from a long line of doctors so naturally I was pre\u00admed from the womb. On top of that, I had two years of high school experience being the only girl in an AP Computer Science course of 20 dudes\u2014I had no intention of prolonging that experience. I started Stanford as an intended Biology major, enrolling in Stanford\u2019s introductory Computer Science course CS106A only through peer pressure.<\/p>\n<p>I loved CS106A so much I ended up taking a CS course every quarter my freshman year, and I declared my major in the fall of 2013. As I progressed further in my track, taking upper-level courses, I watched the number of girls in my CS classes slowly dwindle to the point that I could count 20 girls in a 100-\u00adperson class on a good day (and two of them would just turn out to be men with long hair). And I began noticing all the inklings of sexism, something I\u2019d previously thought of as media folklore.<\/p>\n<p>The first red flag came beginning of sophomore year. I\u2019d just spent two of the best months of my life as a summer intern at Facebook, developing an iOS app. A group of classmates were discussing how we&#8217;d spent the summer. When a boy \u2013 let\u2019s call him Rush (like Rush Limbaugh) &#8212; heard my friend had interned at Facebook, his mouth dropped. \u201cWow! Facebook! You must be really smart!\u201d He then turned to me and asked the exact same question: <em>What did you do this summer<\/em>?<\/p>\n<p>Except when I responded the same \u2014 \u201cFacebook\u201d \u2014 I got a completely different response. \u201cOh&#8230; well then I should have applied for that internship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I was floored. What did he mean by that? Why would he react so differently? I didn\u2019t even know Rush well, so what about me could possibly make my internship at Facebook suddenly seem like a giveaway, a charity case?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d completed all the same programming assignments, undergone the same interview processes as everyone else \u2014 was it something I said? Was I dumb?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been two years since that moment, and since then, I\u2019ve experienced a lot more negative, almost comically sexist behavior.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I\u2019ve been told that \u201cgirls don\u2019t code because they\u2019re, you know, artsier\u201d;<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019ve had middle\u00ad-aged coworkers (not at Facebook, another internship) literally GChat me pickup lines (that aren\u2019t even clever) to the point I\u2019d avoid certain portions of the office altogether;<\/li>\n<li>and I\u2019ve been cornered by a stranger at night outside Stanford\u2019s Gates Building when leaving office hours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While these examples may seem incredible for their blatancy, the hardest discrimination I\u2019ve probably had to face is unconscious bias.<\/p>\n<p>I can easily contest outrageously sexist comments with \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that!\u201d But it\u2019s much harder to call out people for their subtle prejudices. In particular, unconscious bias has raised problems in aspects of my life I couldn\u2019t have expected: my dresses and my voice.<\/p>\n<p>I love to wear dresses, for reasons both practical and personal: 1) they make it seem like I tried and 2) they provide a level of comfort constricting pant legs never could. In fact, I love fashion in general, and every time \u201cHollaback Girl\u201d comes on the radio I pray to the goddess of quasi\u00ad-Harajuku style that is Gwen Stefani.<\/p>\n<p>But dresses and kimonos stand out in a sea of techie uniforms\u2014jeans and free tech company t\u00adee-shirts. I noticed I got better feedback from interviewers when I \u201clooked the part.\u201d So on days I had on\u00ad campus interviews, I sacrificed my dresses for boxy company tee\u00ad-shirts. Even when I did wear company tee\u00ad-shirts, I was sometimes assumed to be a recruiter in the same way women in scrubs are assumed to be nurses.<\/p>\n<p>Worst of all, a 50-\u00adyear-\u00adold married, male coworker at one internship would regularly make it a point in passing to comment on how \u201cfun\u201d my dresses looked. Thus was sucked the enjoyment from wearing dresses and on went the pants.<\/p>\n<p>My high-pitched voice also became an unexpected source of frustration as team meetings became small battlegrounds for respect. At another company (which I prefer not to name), I noticed that management listened more to what my male counterparts had to say even though I was offering insightful feedback. Managers asked my male coworkers about the status of projects, although I was touching all the same files. The guys were praised more on their progress although I was pushing the same amount of code.<\/p>\n<p>And if that wasn\u2019t enough, my achievement was questioned by male colleagues. I\u2019d occasionally hear, \u201cOh you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ll get a job at Google or Facebook just fine!\u201d Which was the most discouraging encouragement. If I did get the internship, it was because I was a woman and if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d just failed to leverage my upper edge.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, the same field that has forced me into contact with people who spew gold the likes of \u201cGirls only care about having babies!\u201d has also brought wonderful female (and male) engineers, entrepreneurs and executives into my life. When I was frustrated about my reception at team meetings, I turned to my mentor, the founder of Bluebird Art, Min Liu, and she advised me to \u201ccut the weeds and water the flowers.\u201d When I felt like a minnow in the shark tank that is software recruiting, Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou advised me to research a little bit into a lot of different technologies to establish my technical fluency.<\/p>\n<p>The supportive men in my life also encouraged me to be heard. Jason Prado, my mentor at Facebook, encouraged me to make big design decisions in our iOS app at Facebook when I barely trusted my own fashion taste. A classmate encouraged me to reach out to people I\u2019d previously thought unreachable. And of course, my dad has been rooting for me from the start.<\/p>\n<p>Slowly but steadily, I am learning to see my dresses and high\u00ad-pitched voice not as hurdles to my success, but as symbols of the perspective I bring to the table.<\/p>\n<p>I see in this bias the opportunity to fill the gender gap with my unique perspective, the ability to inject my opinions and desires into the engineering process. And in an industry where a single line of code can touch literally billions of people, I see the opportunity to maximize my opinions and desires at a scale no other industry can offer.<\/p>\n<p><em>Lea Coligado is a junior at Stanford University from Dallas, Texas majoring in Computer Science.

Starting in the early 2000s, China made a lofty goal to leapfrog the West in automotive technology by becoming a world leader in electric cars. The government declared it would have around 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2011. That didn\u2019t happen. In fact, China sold fewer than 6,000 that year. Even as electric vehicle sales have swelled in America and Japan, China\u2019s attempt to surpass the U.S. in automotive technology has sputtered.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Until recently, China\u2019s lagging electric vehicle industry stood in sharp contrast to its overall auto industry. From 2000 through 2014, China\u2019s auto market expanded at an astonishing rate. In 2000, the country produced fewer passenger cars than Spain \u2013 about 2 million, according to statistics from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. However, China\u2019s Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported last month that 2014 automotive sales surpassed 23 million \u2013 making China by far the largest auto market in the world. In 2011, the World Bank estimated <i>per capita<\/i> vehicle ownership in China at only 69 per thousand people, compared to about 800 per thousand people in the U.S. So China\u2019s industry has significant room for growth.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The rise of China\u2019s auto industry has been fueled by foreign investment, oil and technology \u2013 and it has brought with it a suffocating smog epidemic in China\u2019s largest cities that is driving away wealthy Chinese and foreign expats. China\u2019s Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang has long been working on a plan to replace foreign energy, innovation and capital with domestic resources. He is a former Audi engineer and over more than a decade, his goal has been to overtake the West in automotive technology by pushing China past the era of internal combustion engines and toward electric vehicles \u2013 thus setting the stage for China to dominate the $2 trillion-plus global auto market. Wan Gang also sees electric vehicles as one partial solution to China\u2019s sooty air.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">My book, <i>The Great Race: The Global Quest for the Car of the Future,<\/i> tells how up until recently that project has been a series of ambitious failures. As late as January 2014, China was selling only about 600 electric cars per month \u2013 that same month the U.S. sold over 6,000.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But during the last four months of 2014, China\u2019s electric vehicle sales skyrocketed. In December alone, monthly sales of passenger and commercial electric vehicles hit 27,000. According to data from the China Automotive Technology Research Center and the Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory, sales of electric cars in China surpassed sales of electric cars in the U.S. for the first time. In fact, China\u2019s electric vehicle sales in December 2014 were almost 30 times higher than January 2014 sales.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Many analysts say that the last four months of 2014 will be remembered as the stretch when China\u2019s electric vehicle market finally turned a corner. If this growth continues, China may surpass the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles in 2015.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">All this raises a number of questions: First, are these sales figures reliable? Statistics on China\u2019s automotive market are often vague and unreliable. But statistics from the China Automotive Technology Research Center \u2013 a massive technical body responsible for everything from crash testing to vehicle battery standards \u2014 tend to be good. Some would say they are the gold standard in Chinese automotive data. The website <a href=\"http:\/\/ev-sales.blogspot.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">EV-sales.blogspot.com<\/span><\/a> essentially confirmed the 2014 numbers \u2013 supported by sales numbers for individual models. EV-salesblogspot.com reported that Tesla was outsold by five domestic manufacturers in China: BYD, Kandi, Chery Zotye and BAIC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That leads to a second question: why are sales booming? An analyst from the China Automotive Technology Research Center attributed the jump to the elimination of the vehicle tax on Chinese electric vehicles (until September 2014, buyers were taxed at 10% of the purchase price). But is it really possible that lifting a 10% tax could cause such a massive surge in sales? Perhaps. Policy-led price adjustments have sometimes had spectacular results in China\u2019s auto market. For instance, when the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it lowered import tariffs on foreign automobiles. That year, China\u2019s auto market grew by 37%, as some domestic producers were forced to lower prices to remain competitive. When Chinese automaker First Automotive Works Tianjin reduced its sticker price for one model by 20%, sales shot up 900%, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/mams.rmit.edu.au\/iakd0nbpx54i.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">one study on the Chinese auto market<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">More recently, when China\u2019s auto market started to slow in February 2008 \u2013 together with the rest of the world \u2013 the country sought to stimulate automotive sales and encourage its citizens to buy cleaner cars by cutting taxes on small displacement gasoline engines. In March, 2008 the central government cut taxes on these small cars to 5% from 10%. Auto sales jumped by 22% in April, and grew by 49% annually in 2009. That <span class=\"s1\">was the <\/span>year China became the largest auto market in the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s still far from clear what factors are driving China\u2019s recent electric vehicle boom \u2013 and why Tesla was left out. It\u2019s possible that year-end government procurement led to unusually strong numbers in December. Another possibility is that China\u2019s policies to promote electric vehicles have finally reached a tipping point. For instance, to deal with traffic congestion in major Chinese cities, many municipal governments \u2013 including Beijing \u2013 have limited the number of new vehicle registrations. In Beijing, electric vehicles are exempt from this quota system. <span class=\"s1\"> The central government <\/span>has also instituted a new set of policies to encourage competition among domestic manufacturers \u2014 <span class=\"s1\">competitive pressure <\/span>that was woefully lacking during the early years of China\u2019s electric vehicle program. Perhaps locally produced vehicles have finally reached a quality threshold that make them attractive to Chinese buyers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Whatever the reason, just as China\u2019s electric vehicle market is taking off, Tesla is facing new competitive challenges at home and abroad. Traditional automakers like BMW, Volkswagen <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VOW3\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/vow3\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VOW3<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>and General Motors <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GM\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/gm\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GM<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> are developing electric vehicles that are faster, cheaper, and boast better range than before. In fact, in October 2014, Volkswagen\u2019s CEO Jochem Heizmann announced the company was developing more than 20 electric vehicles for the Chinese market. Then there is also the prospect of competition from newcomers like tech giant Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/aapl\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> \u2013 which is hiring away Tesla\u2019s engineers for princely sums and is rumored to be developing its own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/02\/apple-making-car-isnt-ridiculous-think\/\"><span class=\"s3\">electric car<\/span><\/a>. At the same time, Tesla is struggling to establish its brand in the world\u2019s key emerging market at what may be a critical inflection point. That is a huge problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Perhaps that explains why Musk is losing his cool over weak China sales. Up until recently, China has been an underperforming electric vehicle market, and Tesla has been an over-achieving electric vehicle company.

pointed to the growing skepticism of large food makers that has resulted from consumers&#8217; changing tastes as a key challenge for her industry.<\/p>\n<p>The company, whose portfolio of products ranges from V8 juice to Pepperidge Farm cake to its namesake soups, has found itself grappling with big changes in consumer behavior, in particular growing interest in fresh food and consumers much more keen to know what impact what they&#8217;re eating is having on their health and where it&#8217;s from.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that has been a &#8220;mounting distrust of so-called Big Food, the large food companies and legacy brands on which millions of consumers have relied on for so long,&#8221; Campbell CEO Denise Morrison said on Wednesday at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York meeting in New York.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Like other companies in our industry, we&#8217;re contending with now not just the long-term impact of the Great Recession on consumer purchasing behavior, or the increasingly complex public dialog when it comes to food, or the regulatory environment for food.&#8221; What&#8217;s more, the traditional avenue for selling Campbell&#8217;s products\u2014grocery stores\u2014are coming under a lot of pressure from alternative retailers she said.<\/p>\n<p>Campbell recently lowered its full-year results forecast after only one quarter, suggesting it doesn&#8217;t expect much relief in the pressure on its profit margins anytime soon. In January, Campbell said it would re-organize its divisions according to product category, rather than by geographic region. It plans to eliminate some management layers as well. Campbell estimates its cost-cutting measures will save it $200 million a year.<\/p>\n<p>Campbell is by no means the only food maker struggling to adapt to new consumer behavior. Last week, cereal maker Kellogg <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"K\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/k\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">K<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> cut its long-term annual revenue growth estimate to a range of 1% to 3%, excluding some items, from an earlier forecast of 3% to 4%, citing poor cereal and snacks sales.<\/p>\n<p>Morrison&#8217;s comments about adapting to changing consumer attitudes echoed those of a major competitor. &#8220;I don\u2019t think Kraft has done as aggressive of a job in this regard as we need to,\u201d said John Cahill, who in December became CEO of Kraft Foods <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"KRFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/krft\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">KRFT<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, last week.

href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/magazine\/the-stanford-undergraduate-and-the-mentor.html\" target=\"_blank\">recently profiled<\/a> the troubling, potentially criminal relationship between a former Stanford student, Ellie Clougherty, and entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale who was, among other things, Clougherty\u2019s mentor for the undergraduate course Engineering 145: Technology Entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>As the story unfolds, it becomes increasingly disturbing. Lonsdale and Clougherty\u2019s relationship evolves from that of a mentor and mentee into a romantic relationship and then, Clougherty alleges, into something much more disturbing\u2014including sexual harassment and assault. Clougherty took the case to Stanford officials and Lonsdale was banned from the Stanford campus for ten years (though that ban seems theoretical at best, given that, according to Bazelon, \u201cLonsdale has been invited to campus for a private lunch which he attended with the university\u2019s permission.\u201d). Clougherty filed a civil suit in January and Lonsdale has <a href=\"http:\/\/joelonsdalestatement.com\/\">responded, vigorously<\/a>, and filed a countersuit, denying Clougherty\u2019s accusations.<\/p>\n<p>Clougherty graduated from Stanford in 2013 and is looking to build a career that involves brain research, tech and social activism.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a murky situation\u2014but a mentoring relationship went horribly wrong. Clearly both professional and personal boundaries were crossed inappropriately\u2014and a young woman who was supposed to be mentored and encouraged professionally was, instead, embroiled in what was, at <em>best<\/em>, an unhealthy relationship with someone who possessed undue influence.<\/p>\n<p>There is ample evidence that mentoring for college students can have a significant impact on how prepared recent graduates feel as they enter the workplace. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2014\/05\/06\/gallup-surveys-graduates-gauge-whether-and-why-college-good-well-being\">2014 Gallup study<\/a> of 30,000 college students found that mentoring opportunities were remarkably important to long term career success and satisfaction. Brandon Busteed, the executive director of Gallup Education <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/views\/2014\/09\/25\/essay-about-importance-mentors-college-students\">noted<\/a> how the study revealed that, \u201cthe three most potent elements linked to long-term success for college grads relate to emotional support: feeling that they had a professor who made them excited about learning, that the professors at their alma mater cared about them as a person, and that they had a mentor who encouraged them to pursue their goals and dreams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lonsdale never treated Clougherty as someone who had goals and dreams. Instead, Lonsdale, by engaging in a personal relationship with his young mentee, treated her as a romantic conquest. He ignored his professional responsibility for personal gain. Lonsdale insists that, \u201cEllie is a forceful person,\u201d as if, somehow, that negates the inherent power imbalance not only in a mentor\/mentee relationship, but also between a 21-year old college student and a hugely successful 29-year old entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p>It should go without saying, but mentors cannot treat the mentor\/mentee relationship as a garden of earthly delights. They have one primary responsibility in such a relationship\u2014to provide support and guidance for young men and women. Mentees are not potential romantic interests or sexual conquests. They are not potential acolytes or personal assistants. The mentor\/mentee relationship is a professional one and should be treated as such. If there is a temptation to cross lines, resist. There is a responsibility attached to being a mentor. Mentors must live up to that responsibility. It really is that simple.<\/p>\n<p>Alumni are a natural source of mentoring for colleges and universities. These alumni and their success stories are living proof that the education at any given college or university works, and that the current students are making a wise, invaluable investment in their future. Joe Lonsdale is one of countless alumni who have been tapped by their alma maters to work with promising undergraduates. Unfortunately, though, many universities seem to think that getting mentors on campus is all they need to do. There is, all too often, little oversight and few systems in place to help students when these relationships become troubled.<\/p>\n<p>Universities and colleges can\u2019t merely provide mentoring opportunities for their students. They need to monitor those relationships to ensure they are functioning productively and mutually for both the mentor and the mentee. There needs to be a system of checks and balances, if you will. Had the professor of the course who originally assigned Lonsdale to mentor Ellie Clougherty engaged in even the most basic of oversight, a great deal of suffering might have been averted. We cannot undo what has been done but universities and colleges can work to ensure that such a problematic mentoring relationship never happens again.<\/p>\n<p><em>Roxane Gay is an English professor at Purdue University and a <\/em>New York Times<em> best-selling author.

In the Chinese zodiac, each Lunar New Year, which is celebrated by many Asian cultures, is associated with one of 12 animal signs. This is the Year of the Sheep (also referred to as the Year of the Ram or Goat).<\/p>\n<p>To mark the occasion, Panda Express, the nation\u2019s largest Chinese restaurant group, is giving out red envelopes to customers stuffed with coupons for either a free soda or a free order of Firecracker Chicken Breast. Peggy Cherng, co-founder and co-CEO of Panda, will also be passing out red envelopes filled with a fresh $1 bill to every employee at its Rosemead, Calif., corporate headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>Godiva is selling limited edition Year of the Goat gift boxes, with sweets that combine its traditional Belgian chocolate with edible flowers and exotic root flavors. Chase Bank is giving out traditional Chinese calendars and red envelopes to customers who want to give out their own gifts of money.<\/p>\n<p>So what kind of economic year can we expect?<\/p>\n<p>Doris Ingber, an expert in feng shui and 4 Pillars Analysis (a branch of Chinese astrology), says 2015 will be a year dominated by the economy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are at a turning point in the 12-year cycle,\u201d says Ingber, who has offices in New York and Norwalk, Conn. \u201cThe energy of wood, which represents the economy, is beginning to flower. Unemployment is down, wages are moving up, and costs have stabilized or lowered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ingber says she\u2019s often called in by businesses for staffing issues, and after the fact, when a company\u2019s strategy isn\u2019t working.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn China, they look at feng shui and astrology first, before putting together teams of people and designing spaces,\u201d Ingber says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a bit of woowoo-ness to this in the United States, so many companies still don\u2019t talk about using it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ingber says she left a career in fashion merchandising in 1999. \u201cI took the sales figures, looked at what went on in the past, and looked at what was coming in the next cycle,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Now, I\u2019m dealing with the science of intuition, and use software programs for feng shui and Chinese astrology to analyze information.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ingber, whose clients include investment advisers, designers who work with commercial and residential properties, healthcare providers and others, says portfolios should remain diversified to produce steady growth. \u201cBe cautious,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is not a year for risk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She explains that five elements (Wood, Earth, Fire, Metal and Water) affect everyone, and that the energy of each element can relate to industries.<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese astrology expert says Wood industries should do well this year, as the element &#8212; which represents growth and change &#8212; dominates 2015. That makes this the Year of the Wood Sheep.<\/p>\n<p>Wood industries include architecture, manufacturing with natural products, fashion, food, publications like newspapers, magazines and books, and education. \u201cThose who listen and communicate with their customers will thrive,\u201d Ingber says.<\/p>\n<p>Earth industries will be stable, consistent performers, including businesses that deal with real estate, building, gas\/oil, mining, insurance, accounting, law and human resources.<\/p>\n<p>Fire industries, she notes, are a safe bet, and include electricity\/power companies, restaurants, the performing arts, entertainment, military and defense companies.<\/p>\n<p>Metal industries are weak, including banking, technology (hardware), automobile manufacturing, engineering, and entrepreneurs or CEOs. \u201cCompanies and their leaders need to be more nimble, quick and flexible this year,\u201d Ingber says. \u201cThis year\u2019s energy supports those who are humanitarian and lead from a team-building orientation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, water industries are weak now, but are good investments for the future, she says. Service providers, transportation, tourism, and health care practitioners will not have a great year, but if businesses act with long-term gains in mind, they will show great strength in 2019, the Year of the Pig.<\/p>\n<p>Clashing elements this year, Ingber notes, indicate more national and global discord, but conflicts will be less violent than in 2014. Dry, hot areas of the world and summer months will see flare-ups, but Ingber is optimistic that treaties and mergers will come out of the conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>Politics will take center stage, affecting the economy and vice versa. The key to settling conflicts include bi-partisan alliances, global cooperation, and team-building in the workplace. The stock market will perform similarly to last year, she adds.<\/p>\n<p>While some industries may be predisposed to do better than others this year, everything depends on the individuals in the teams that leaders choose, she adds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d want people in sales and marketing to have fire in their chart,\u201d she says. \u201cA CEO will need to have metal. The designer should have wood. In a year that\u2019s all about money, the opportunity for prosperity is there for everyone, if we take advantage of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, here are Ingber\u2019s tips for creating prosperity in this Year of the Wood Sheep:<\/p>\n<p>* Avoid direct confrontations\u2026 compromise and negotiation will achieve more than conflict;<\/p>\n<p>* Home, food, clothing and comfort are a priority\u2026 surround yourself with beautiful, quality things, or make sure that what you produce is done with quality materials;<\/p>\n<p>* Create powerful allies and strong connections;<\/p>\n<p>* Master the soft sell technique;<\/p>\n<p>* Be responsible in your decision-making\u2026 be the shepherd; and<\/p>\n<p>* Focus on charity and humanitarian acts\u2026 the sheep will reward you.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 17, 2015","published":"2015-02-17 06:00:40","updated":"2015-02-17 06:00:40","minute":"6:00 AM EST","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/17\/chinese-new-year-marketing\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/17\/chinese-new-year-marketing\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/17\/chinese-new-year-marketing\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"It's Chinese New Year: A financial astrologer predicts 2015","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/463053998.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by Philippe Lopez \u2014 AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"A man takes a picture of a hand-made decorative lion head in Hong Kong on February 9, 2015, during an exhibition about the traditional lion dance which is performed in many countries of Asia during the Chinese New Year.

That increase is at least $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage.

Wal-Mart said by February of next year, all current U.S. associates would make $10 an hour or more. The company is also piloting a training program to help employees move out of entry-level positions and potentially make $15 an hour and more with increased responsibilities.

The poll found that the health care industry severely lags\u2014except for one company: Aetna <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AET\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/aet\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AET<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>An email purportedly sent from a typical health insurance company is, for instance, four times likelier to be fraudulent than an email that claims to be from a social media company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The poor folks in health care have traditionally not had much digital interaction. They&#8217;re the ones furthest behind by a country mile,&#8221; says Patrick Peterson, Agari founder and CEO.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;state of email trust&#8221; survey, which ranks businesses based on their implementation of email security protocols, found that Aetna scored a perfect 100%. (Of the banks, Chase and Capital One also scored perfectly.) None of the other 13 health care companies surveyed even broke out of the &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; category, all falling below the middle mark. In fact, the average score for the sector was a pitiful 17%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it wasn\u2019t for Aetna the score would be half or quarter of that,&#8221; Peterson says, adding: &#8220;Anthem, quite unsurprisingly, did very poorly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In comparison, the industry with the highest ranked email security practices was social media at 67%. On the other hand, the second lowest scoring industry was European megabanks, which scored 33%.<\/p>\n<p>Each percentage presented by the survey reflects a weighted score for an industry&#8217;s or company&#8217;s email authentication practices. These consist of three standard email security protocols: Sender Policy Framework, or SPF, which checks emails against a list of authorized senders (servers approved for a given domain); DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM, which verifies the authenticity of a sender through encrypted digital signatures; and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, or DMARC, which checks emails against a published record on a company&#8217;s servers, notifies the company of any potentially spoofed emails, and rejects suspicious emails as spam. Of the three protocols, the last is the most important, Peterson says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"33\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3751418463001-33\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3751418463001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1EsbJtM\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dandrewnusca%2Ccomputers%2Ccyber%2Chackers%2Cplaystation%2Croberthackett%2Csecurity%2Csony%2Csybersecurity%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dtechdebate&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>DMARC, a three-year-old technology pioneered by PayPal <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"EBAY\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ebay\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">EBAY<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\u2014which had been the most phished brand in the world for years, according to Peterson\u2014relies on an information-sharing partnership between businesses (like banks and health insurers) and email providers like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and AOL (which are a few who have so far adopted it). Whereas before such companies relied on customers to report fishy emails, now they can effectively cross-check the emails themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It gives visibility from the inbox in realtime to what criminals are trying to do in realtime to defraud customers,&#8221; says Peterson.<\/p>\n<p>Although adopting better email security practices such as these protocols would not prevent a breach like Anthem&#8217;s, they would contribute to a safer web. And if more companies opted in, the threat of phishing\u2014counterfeiting emails in order to obtain sensitive personal information from recipients\u2014would, so the idea goes, plummet.<\/p>\n<p>Email phishing continues to be a major problem. The proportion of espionage incidents incorporating targeted phishing attacks\u2014known as &#8220;spear phishing&#8221;\u2014is 67% <a href=\"\/\/\/Users\/rhackett1271\/Downloads\/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf\">according to a 2014 Verizon data breach investigations report<\/a>. Retailer Target&#8217;s breach was likely the result of a phishing attack. The FBI maintains that Sony&#8217;s breach was the result of a phishing attack. And though it is unconfirmed, Peterson and others in the security community believe Anthem&#8217;s breach was the result of a phishing attack as well.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Something that highly trained spies used to spend a great deal of time infiltrating at great risk, they&#8217;ve basically vacuumed up in one fell swoop,&#8221; Peterson said of the Anthem hackers. &#8220;In that data set of 80 million are CEOs, government officials. I think they&#8217;re going to go through and figure out espionage targets now that they have the personal information they need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aetna, the most secure health care company in terms of email according to the survey, stands out among its peers in its pursuit of best practices. &#8220;What Aetna is doing is protecting all members and consumers from receiving fraudulent email some of which is phishing attempts,&#8221; said Jim Routh, Aetna&#8217;s chief information security officer. &#8220;In our case, 60 million fraudulent emails are not going to be delivered to consumers or members this year because of DMARC,&#8221; he said, extrapolating from the number of spam emails the company has seen in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Routh, former global head of application and mobile security at J.P. Morgan, which experienced its own data breach last year, likens the process of implementing DMARC to &#8220;herding cats,&#8221; given the number of third parties that send emails on behalf of big organizations. Each third party sender has to register as a subdomain and implement the implement and enforce the authentication protocols. Routh says it cost very little to set up compared to other labor and resource-intensive initiatives\u2014like securing and monitoring every network endpoint, or training software developers to embed security controls in their products during the development process\u2014but would not divulge an exact amount.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson and Routh both agree that the reason more companies have not adopted DMARC sooner is because of a kind of corporate inertia\u2014a tendency to stick to tradition. They also believe that the people in these organizations who understand these emails protocols typically have less political clout to drive change.<\/p>\n<p>A third reason for stalling is because even when a company opts in, customers may not realize it. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like one day you say, &#8216;Oh, I didn&#8217;t get phished today!'&#8221; Routh says. &#8220;It&#8217;s more gradual, and so a consumer frankly doesn\u2019t know it.&#8221; In the long term, though, the protections afforded by DMARC may protect customer&#8217;s relationships with brands.<\/p>\n<p>Adoption of better security measures and the prosecution of high profile botmasters, among other things, have contributed to a decline in the volume of spam in the past couple years\u2014though spam still accounts for two thirds of global mail, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcafee.com\/us\/resources\/reports\/rp-quarterly-threat-q3-2014.pdf\">according to the November 2014 McAfee Labs threats report<\/a>. Still, the severity of the phishing threat is on the rise as campaigns become more highly targeted and well-crafted.

Early in 2014 the rookie hedge fund manager noticed something unusual: The amount of crude oil being stockpiled around the world was building much faster than normal for that time of year. The growing excess in supply wasn\u2019t yet reflected in the market, however. Benchmark oil prices continued to hover around the same lofty level they had occupied for the previous few years\u2014near or above $100 per barrel. Increasingly this was considered the new normal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Goldberg had just launched his BBL Commodities Value Fund the previous September, but he was hardly a newcomer to oil markets. He had spent the previous decade as a trader, first for Goldman Sachs and then for Swiss commodities giant Glencore. His strategy for BBL was to trade oil \u201cacross the barrel\u201d\u2014refined products as well as crude itself\u2014and to stay focused on short-term opportunities while keeping one eye on the horizon. \u201cOur views are three months, six months, maybe a year,\u201d says the 33-year-old Goldberg. \u201cAnd we<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">are very sensitive to day-to-day, week-to-week fluctuations. I\u2019ve never understood the point of putting a position on until I actually thought it was going to make money.\u201d That January he rode bullish bets on natural gas and U.S. distillate prices to a 7% monthly gain. But he began to realize that something bigger might be brewing in crude.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Goldberg and his team watched closely as the stockpiling accelerated. By the end of the first quarter, the trend was clear. A gusher of new supply driven by the stunning growth in U.S. shale oil production\u2014accounting for most of the 80% spike in overall U.S. production since the end of 2008\u2014was beginning to overwhelm demand. And yet oil prices continued to defy gravity, propelled by fears of supply disruptions. Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine and the emerging threat of a new Islamic state in northern Iraq caused crude to hit new highs in late June. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The trader stayed patient, waiting for a catalyst that would spur a drop. By the early fall Goldberg noticed that the cash prices being paid for physical oil were significantly lower than even the suddenly weakening futures prices. He became more confident that it was time to be short oil.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996187\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=345\" alt=\"INT1-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"345\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Then the bottom fell out. On Nov. 27, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that, contrary to the assumptions of much of the oil industry, it would not cut its production to defend higher prices. Crude went into free fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark for so-called light sweet crude oil, tumbled from its June high of $108 to a low in January of $44. Goldberg was well positioned for the crash. His fund made 26% in December alone and finished with a return after fees of 51.3% for the year, pushing assets up to $540 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now the question for Goldberg and others is, what happens next? What are the implications of a 50% markdown of crude\u2014in terms of cost structure, demand growth, and production? Will prices remain low for a sustained period or rebound quickly? To answer that, you have to study oil\u2019s new calculus. For the near term anyway, expect volatility, not consensus. \u201cThe only thing that there\u2019s agreement on is that it\u2019s a lot more challenging than the old math,\u201d says Dan Yergin, the vice chairman of information and analytics company IHS and the author of the essential oil-history tomes <i>The Prize<\/i> and <i>The Quest.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For most of the players in the multi-trillion-dollar oil and gas industry, crude\u2019s swift plunge has been almost as surprising as it has been costly. In November, S&amp;P Capital IQ surveyed energy professionals and asked them what they thought the price of Brent crude would be at the beginning of January: $50, $80, or $100 per barrel? The most common answer (78%) was $80; just 2% picked $50. This conviction was based on a couple of assumptions: First, that the cost of adding new production, in U.S. shale fields and elsewhere, was somewhere around $75 to $80 per barrel. Second, that Saudi Arabia, the driving force within OPEC and the shock absorber in oil markets for the past 40 years, would cut production if necessary to keep prices from falling too low.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_2.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"EasyJet Plc Passenger Jets At London Gatwick Airport Ahead Of Results\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A ground-crew worker connects a fuel hose to the wing of an Airbus aircraft.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Simon Dawson\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">Blinded by these beliefs, the industry as a whole failed to recognize what, in hindsight, should have been obvious: that a developing glut made a price correction almost inevitable\u2014especially with the Saudis signaling that they had no intention of cutting back production. \u201cThis was what they call in science an \u2018available insight,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of asset manager GMO, which oversees $120 billion, and a widely respected identifier of market imbalances of all types. Grantham laments that he, too, failed to predict the price plunge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The fallout from the drop has been swift and brutal. Publicly traded oil companies have lost billions in market value, and both public and private firms are moving aggressively to cut capital spending budgets for 2015\u2014laying off thousands of workers and shutting down hundreds of rigs. This is especially true in the new boomtowns that have powered the shale oil revolution in the U.S. (For an on-the-ground report from North Dakota oil country, see \u201cWaiting for the Reckoning.\u201d) If the downturn drags on, there will almost certainly be bankruptcies and acquisitions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a textbook implosion with regard to exploration and production capital spending domestically because the industry was leveraged to very high oil prices,\u201d says Bill Herbert, a senior researcher at Houston oil and gas investment bank Simmons &amp; Co. \u2009\u201cAnd the E&amp;P companies have been living outside of cash flow since the implosion of 2009, when the financial system essentially collapsed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Indeed, a recent paper by IHS concluded that spending on production growth in the U.S. from 2009 through 2013 had exceeded cash flow by an astounding $272 billion\u2014and at least 40% of that was raised by taking on debt. Additional credit will presumably be hard to come by. But industry observers are anticipating a wave of opportunistic investments by private equity firms. Blackstone, for instance, reportedly just raised $4.5 billion for a new fund focused on energy investments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, the industry is taking a hard look at costs. \u201cCompanies are reorienting themselves to a low-price environment,\u201d says Yergin. \u201cA decade ago they had to adjust to a higher price, and costs went way up.\u201d But even before last year\u2019s dive in prices, says Yergin, controlling costs had become the No. 1 issue for top execs at the major energy companies. \u201cIf that was a preoccupation before the price collapse, it\u2019s now an obsession,\u201d says Yergin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Even as companies move quickly into survival mode on the ground, the industry is struggling to get a handle on future prices: Will the market\u2019s corrective forces bring supply and demand back into alignment in a matter of months? Or will this be more like 1986\u2014an eerily familiar scenario in which an OPEC decision to keep pumping oil after a flood of new supply ended up tanking prices for years? After bottoming\u2014at least temporarily\u2014in late January, benchmark prices rallied in early February, with WTI reaching $53 and Brent at $62 as of presstime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But crude production continues to surge as a result of wells already drilled\u2014and stockpiles of the excess continue to grow. In early February the amount of oil in storage in the U.S., excluding the strategic petroleum reserve, reached 417 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the highest level at that time of year in at least 80 years. Barring a major disruption of supply elsewhere in the world, it\u2019s unlikely that prices will see a strong rally until those inventories begin to recede. But the slowdown in drilling should eventually put the brakes on production growth in shale. Unlike traditional onshore oilfields, which might have an annual production decline of 5% or less, shale oil wells often decline more than 50% in their first year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The oil market remains in what\u2019s known as contango\u2014with the future price of crude trading at a higher level than today\u2019s spot price. That suggests a belief that prices will rebound, at least somewhat. In mid-February, for instance, December 2017 Brent crude futures were trading above $73\u2014or about 18% higher than the spot price. This has led traders to take oil off the market\u2014in some cases by leasing supertankers for extra, floating storage capacity\u2014in hopes that they will be able to sell it back later at a higher price. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d says Chris Bake, a member of the executive committee of Vitol, the world\u2019s largest independent oil trader. \u201cWe do it here because the market is asking us to do it. It\u2019s saying, \u2018Gentlemen, we do not have a home for this oil today. Can you please take it off my hands?\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_3.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">As inventories pile up, more oil is being stored in tanks, like these in the area surrounding Cushing, Okla.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Daniel Shea<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The outlook for consumption is murky. The International Energy Agency has lowered its demand forecast several times in the past couple of years, and in a recent report cautioned that both China, the biggest demand driver, and the global economy more generally were becoming less fuel-intensive. Still, the IEA projects demand to grow by more than 7 million barrels per day over the next five years. While lower crude prices mean cheaper gasoline in the U.S., which should spur demand, that\u2019s not so much the case in other countries, where taxes represent a higher portion of the cost of gas (as in Europe).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A pair of recent reports suggest that the industry can stay in hunker-down mode for a while\u2014as long as prices don\u2019t crash much further. In January energy specialists Wood MacKenzie analyzed its database of 2,222 oil-producing fields around the world and found that a mere 0.2% of the world\u2019s supply would be operating on a cash-negative basis at $50 per barrel for Brent. At $40, the number rose to just 1.6%. And a study by IHS concluded that wells accounting for 47% of new U.S. oil production in 2014 could break even with the price of WTI below $61.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Once supply and demand come back into balance, points out Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer\u2019s senior oil analyst, prices should gravitate toward the marginal cost of production of new barrels. But where that ends up is another subject of debate. Five years ago, says Gheit, the industry needed oil at $90 to justify the development of new production of U.S. oil shale. Now that figure is significantly less, he believes, and continued technology gains will drive it lower. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this industry for 30 years,\u201d says Gheit, \u201cand I can tell you that the shale revolution has changed the calculus. In my view shale will never die. It\u2019s here to stay.\u201d He forecasts higher prices but not a return to triple digits.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Grantham has a different view. After studying oil prices over long periods, the GMO chief strategist has come to believe that there have been two major paradigm shifts when oil reset at higher baseline levels. For decades, he says, the base price, calculated in today\u2019s money, was $16. From there, oil occasionally doubled or dropped by half, but tended to return to $16. The rise of OPEC in the 1970s changed the game, says Grantham, and the baseline price jumped to $35. \u201cWhenever you were down by half, of course, it was the end of the world, it was a New World Order,\u201d says Grantham. \u201cAnd whenever you went up, the same in reverse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996202\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=527\" alt=\"INT2-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"527\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Just after the year 2000, Grantham maintains, the cost of oil inflected as f<span class=\"s3\">inding new supplies became more challenging and expensive<\/span>. That drove the base price up to $75 or $80 per barrel. Since then we have experienced both the doubling (when oil surged to nearly $150 in July 2008) and the halving (when it crashed below $40 in December 2008). Despite the gusher of U.S. shale oil production, Grantham believes that prices are likely to reset higher again\u2014to a baseline above $100\u2014because, outside of shale, finding new oil is getting harder. And there won\u2019t be enough shale production to cover the declines of existing supplies and meet future demand growth. \u201cIf you look at the size of the oilfields discovered, they get smaller and smaller at a heartbreaking rate,\u201d says Grantham. Recent data support the observation. According to IHS, nonshale discoveries have fallen sharply since 2010, and 2014 is \u201clikely to mark\u201d the first year since the 1950s that no conventional giant oilfields (those with more than 500 million barrels in reserves) were found.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">But while Grantham projects that oil will surge higher in the medium term, he ultimately\u2014perhaps 20 or 30 years down the road\u2014sees advances in technology making oil virtually obsolete in transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderfully complicated world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">As for Goldberg, he plans to stick with his process and let the market guide him. The same indicators that made him bearish on prices, he says, could signal that prices are destined to rise again. \u201cI can see a scenario where oil prices get super-bullish again if companies overcut,\u201d he says <\/span>on a recent morning, sitting in his conference room on the 38th floor of an office tower at the bottom tip of Manhattan.<span class=\"s3\"> But he\u2019s not positioned for that yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, he\u2019s staying away from big theories or bold predictions. \u201cThere\u2019s no key to the puzzle,\u201d says Goldberg, who earned a degree in economics at Yale and wrote his thesis on behavioral finance under the guidance of David Swensen, the manager of Yale\u2019s endowment. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone can sit there and figure it out. Like, \u2018Hey, oil\u2019s going to be at $50 in three years.\u2019 Well, maybe. I mean, if demand doesn\u2019t grow, and industry cost cuts are 20%, and we don\u2019t have a war with Ukraine, and Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t change its oil policy, and Libya maybe comes back online, and Nigeria doesn\u2019t blow up\u2014yeah, we\u2019ll probably be at $50. Good luck getting any one of those variables right.\u201d To solve oil\u2019s new math, Goldberg knows, it\u2019s better not to look too far ahead.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 18, 2015","published":"2015-02-18 05:00:24","updated":"2015-02-18 05:00:24","minute":"5:00 PM EST","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/18\/oils-new-math\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/18\/oils-new-math\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/18\/oils-new-math\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_11.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Illustration by Leonello Calvetti for Fortune Magazine","caption":"","attach_id":"996459"},"excerpt":"<p>With prices down by 50%,  the world&#8217;s foremost experts are reworking their assumptions about crude&#8217;s calculus.

The progress shows Wal-Mart&#8217;s efforts to improve its selection of fresh food (grocery is 55% of company sales), its e-commerce firepower and adequate staffing of shelves are starting to show results.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time, Wal-Mart offered investors plenty to worry about (shares fell 3%, wiping $6 billion off its market value), with plenty of investments intended to improve business but that will lead to a lower profit in the fiscal year that just started.

(Last year, the e-commerce growth had been 30%.) The world&#8217;s largest retailer blamed the shortfall on slumping electronics sales (Walmart was particularly aggressive during the holidays in slashing television prices) and a lack of video games for new consoles. The company said it plans to spend as much as 9 cents per share, or $290 million, on improving its e-commerce, to remedy that, even if it means smaller profit margins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Gross profit margin was unchanged during the holiday season despite the sales increase<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So shoppers spent more, visited more (shopper traffic rose 1.4% last quarter, the first increase in 9 quarters) and their mood improved\u2014that yielded a sales increase but an unchanged gross profit margin. That can only mean Walmart cut prices (&#8216;rollbacks&#8217; in company parlance) during the holiday too aggressively, a strategy that was plain to see, what with the company starting Black Friday deals on Nov. 1 and being hard-core in its discounting all the way through the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>Walmart also spent a lot of money to staff more cash registers during the holiday period to address a long time complaint of many shoppers: end lines lines and wait times at checkout.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Comparable sales rose, but far more modestly than the competition&#8217;s<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>U.S. comparable sales, which include online sales and sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1.5%, better than the 0.7% rise analysts expected, and the second straight quarter of growth (after nearly two years of decline or stagnation). But the number could have been better. For one thing, gas prices hit multi-year lows, pumping an extra $5 billion in Americans&#8217; pockets this holiday. For another, last year, Walmart U.S.&#8217; sales had been hurt by cuts to the food stamp programs 20% of customers relied on, making the year-over-year comparison easier to beat for Walmart in 2014.

All that will dent profits this year to the tune of $1 billion. &#8220;Our bottom line will continue to be pressured primarily from the significant investments in associates,&#8221; McMillon said on a pre-recorded call to announced the quarterly results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Some key international markets\u2014i.e. China, Britain and Brazil\u2014still tough<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wal-Mart was the latest U.S. company to warn investors that the strong greenback was hurting sales\u2014in this case, the damage is to the tune of $5 billion. But beyond the currency crunch, Wal-Mart is getting hit in myriad ways in different key countries. In Britain, it was taken by surprise by how much U.K. rivals took to Black Friday, until this year a purely American shopping event. In China, it continued to struggle with shoppers&#8217; perceptions that its prices were not low enough or its food fresh enough. (In Canada, its comparable sales rose, and with Target almost gone from the market, it should see more growth.)<\/p>\n<p>On the whole the company forecast a profit of $4.70 to $5.05 per share this year, the midpoint of which is below the $4.99 Wal-Mart reported for 2014. And it expects U.S. comparable sales (Walmart US is 60% of its business) to rise 1-2% this quarter.<\/p>\n<p>All this shows just how much work is still ahead for Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 03:45:58","updated":"2015-02-19 03:45:58","minute":"3:45 PM

Last year workers gave 10,000 hours.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the stereotype goes, accountants are a species of professional often seen as spiritless human calculators\u2014and not as indispensable visionaries. \u201c\u2018Taxes must be boring.\u2019 I get that all the time,\u201d says Kirt Bocox, senior tax manager at KPMG, one of the firm\u2019s many employees who dispute\u2014indeed refute\u2014that pre-conception. \u201cPeople get the stereotype of accountants completely wrong. It\u2019s actually exciting and fun.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bocox is not the only impassioned one. To hear Bruce Pfau, vice chairman of human resources and communications, tell it, the company, based in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, gushes with enthusiasm. So he devised a plan to harness that energy: Instead of dictating what employees <i>should<\/i> consider their motivating force, the company asked each to think up his or her own and frame it on a poster. HR provided a template on the organization\u2019s internal website, KPMG Today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that culture is the most important dimension of any CEO\u2019s responsibility to an organization,\u201d says John Veihmeyer, global chairman and CEO of KPMG in the U.S., who kicked off the program in June with a video in which he stood on the Top of the Rock in New York City to announce a goal: the \u201c10,000 stories challenge.\u201d If the company received that many posters by Thanksgiving, everyone would earn two extra days of paid vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Posters rolled in by the thousands in the first week\u2014\u201cI advance science,\u201d \u201cI promote peace,\u201d \u201cWe protect our nation.\u201d And they rolled in by the thousands during the second too. Even Phil Mickelson, the KPMG-sponsored pro golfer, joined in with one of his own: \u201cI win titles.\u201d By July the company had blown well past the 10,000 mark\u2014and submissions kept coming. By the time it ended in November, the company had received more than four times the requested number of posters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThe initiative enormously exceeded our expectations, and morale scores soared to historic highs,\u201d says Pfau. In fact, in a recent engagement survey, the percentage of its U.S. employees who endorsed KPMG as a great place to work jumped to 85%. (The firm also had one of its most profitable years to date in its 118-year history.) \u201cThe higher-purpose focus of our firm, combined with its financial performance, makes me the proudest I\u2019ve been in my time here,\u201d Pfau says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bocox, whose job includes helping farmers get loans, created an \u201cI help farms grow\u201d poster, which was featured on the company intranet. He says the program achieved a viral level within the company comparable to that of the ALS ice-bucket challenge that swept social media last summer. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cost a lot to do, but once it got going, it just took off,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bocox spent the extra time off with his brand-new baby daughter. She was born on the last day of December. \u201cPretty good tax planning,\u201d he often jokes while meeting clients. \u201cIf I\u2019m willing to properly tax plan my child\u2019s birth, just think about what I can do for you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 07:30:41","updated":"2015-02-19 07:30:41","minute":"7:30 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/kpmgs-viral-moral-meme\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/kpmgs-viral-moral-meme\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/kpmgs-viral-moral-meme\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"KPMG's viral morale meme","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/gre03_11.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by Chris McEniry for Fortune Magazine","caption":"Kirt Bocox at the KPMG office in Orlando.

However, the wording of its first point implied that Greece wants to haggle over implementing reforms demanded by the original bailout agreement&#8211;an impression reinforced this week as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras promised to introduce new laws rolling back some of the agreement&#8217;s key provisions.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesman for Germany&#8217;s finance ministry dismissed it as &#8220;not a substantial proposal for a solution. In reality, it aims for a bridging loan without fulfilling the demands of the program.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even so, the request is still a major climbdown for the new government, led by Tsipras&#8217; radical left-wing Syriza party, which swept to power on a pledge to overthrow the bailout agreement in January and subsequently declared it &#8220;dead&#8221;. It pledges to honor all of Greece&#8217;s debts and, just as importantly, to continue accepting monitoring visits from the three institutions that have overseen Athens&#8217; implementation of the bailout to date, the hated &#8220;troika&#8221; of European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.<\/p>\n<p>The request comes less than a day after the ECB subtly, but nonetheless significantly, increased the pressure on Greece by voting only a minimal increase in the amount of cash that Greek banks can access from it.<\/p>\n<p>Greeks have reportedly been pulling deposits out of the banking system in increasing numbers recently, scared at the prospect of their country being forced out of the Eurozone. The increase of only \u20ac3.3 billion in the ceiling on Emergency Lending Assistence might have left banks unable to honor requests for withdrawals.

Wilson, in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/gm-shareholder-seeks-spot-on-board-1423577927\">interview<\/a> with the Wall Street Journal, said GM must be \u201cmore attentive to its cash balance and its operating performance\u201d and address \u201cshareholder frustration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The moves by Buffett and Soros were disclosed in filings reflecting increased holdings of GM shares in the fourth quarter of last year, prior to Wilson\u2019s public announcement. Neither has said anything critical of GM; Buffett earlier expressed support for GM management. Each of the men has also expressed interest in <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/29\/why-george-soros-warren-buffett-and-bill-gates-want-auto-dealerships\/\">buying retail automobile dealerships<\/a> in the U.S., Buffett having an agreement to acquire the privately owned Van Tuyl group.<\/p>\n<p>Whether other major investors, and possible other so-called activist investors, decide to join forces to exert pressure on GM isn\u2019t clear \u2013 but investors may be sniffing a potential opportunity at GM: Since early February, the automaker\u2019s share price has moved up more than 12% in an overall market that has gained less than 4%.<\/p>\n<p>Has GM management been successful in remaking the automaker after its 2009 bankruptcy? Evidently, some investors don\u2019t think so, though GM insiders argue that Mary Barra, the chief executive, has made much progress. She\u2019s now feeling Wall Street pressure to do more \u2013 and why not? As the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21642169-why-activist-investors-are-good-public-company-capitalisms-unlikely-heroes\">cover story<\/a> of the February 7 issue of The Economist argued persuasively, activist investors can be effective change agents, turbocharging underperforming public corporations to the benefit of shareholders.<\/p>\n<p>Taconic Parties, Appaloosa Parties, HG Vora Parties and Hayman Parties, which own more than 2% of the automaker, want to be represented on GM\u2019s board, Wilson said. They also want GM to initiate a big share buyback, which theoretically would make remaining shares more valuable.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Buffett and Soros haven\u2019t elaborated publicly about their increases in GM share holdings. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"brk.a\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/brk-a\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">brk.a<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> increased its holdings by one million shares to 41 million, roughly 2.5%. Soros Fund Management raised its position by 728,938 to 4.9 million shares, or less than 1%.<\/p>\n<p>The Detroit-based automaker has a rich history contending with activists: Ross Perot in the mid-1980s. Kirk Kerkorian and Jerry York in 2006. Neither could get through the stubbornness of GM\u2019s executives and directors determined to stay the course. Leading the charge this time is Wilson, 43, an investment banker representing the investment funds. He worked to restructure GM following its bankruptcy in 2009 while working for the U.S. Treasury.<\/p>\n<p>Using publicly available information, The Economist noted that activist investors have mounted campaigns at about 15% of the firms in the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009, demanding board seats, strategy changes and the ouster of executives. Among them: Nelson Peltz at Pepsi. Bill Ackman at Canadian Pacific Railways and Burger King. Carl Icahn at Apple and eBay. Their effectiveness can be debated. In some cases, companies undertook suggested changes, saying they intended to do so anyway. In others, company performance improved, relieving the pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Dissident and activist shareholders once were seen as opportunists, gambling on a payoff\u2014\u201cgreenmail\u201d\u2014or a short-term improvement of share price. The rise of private equity investors represented a different form of activism in which the entire company was bought at a premium, loaded with debt and then restructured. Today\u2019s activist would say the focus is longer-term performance.<\/p>\n<p>With one eye on the activists, corporate boards monitor dividend and stock performance carefully and take steps, lest shareholders grow restive. But shareholders increasingly are large mutual and other funds rather than individuals. Funds tend to sell their stakes when performance lags or avoid sleepy companies altogether.<\/p>\n<p>No one can question the disappointing performance of GM\u2019s stock since the public offering in late 2010, or the simmering political controversy over the $10 billion it cost the U.S. to bail out the automaker. GM\u2019s recent signal that it intends to raise the dividend relates directly to the flat share price.<\/p>\n<p>But GM senior executives also assert the post-bankruptcy automaker is a leaner, more nimble performer \u2013 albeit one that tripped badly in 2014: The ignition-switch safety recalls and reparations have cost multiple billions that might otherwise have been realized as profits. Perhaps sensing investor impatience, GM indicated it intends to raise its quarterly cash dividend.<\/p>\n<p>Alan Batey, president of GM North America, is a native of Great Britain who started with the company 35 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot of defense in the last year,\u201d Batey said in an interview earlier this month at the Chicago Auto Show, referring to the recalls of tens of millions of GM vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget what our dealers have done to help us. They\u2019ve been through hell and back. We\u2019re indebted to them, and this year we\u2019ll play offense.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The annealing qualities of GM\u2019s crises may make its management team tougher and more determined than ever to succeed. If not, a board seat and share buyback may turn out to an opening salvo in a longer, broader conflict over the automaker\u2019s performance.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"

biotechs","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Foundation Medicine,<\/span> a young company that performs genetically targeted cancer tests, announced in January that Roche would buy a $1 billion stake, Foundation\u2019s stock price quickly doubled. Inside the Boston offices of Third Rock Ventures, the partners felt the warm glow of parental pride.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock calls itself a venture capital firm, but it provides much more than funding and guidance for new enterprises. Third Rock hatched the idea for Foundation Medicine in 2008. Third Rock\u2019s team of 50 scientists and technologists designed the company\u2019s service. Third Rock drafted its business plan. The firm then infused the startup with $25 million and picked a CEO to launch it and usher it to an IPO. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock has taken this approach with nearly all of its 36 portfolio companies since its founding in 2007, and it has enjoyed other hits: Agios, which makes drugs to treat genetic disorders and cancer, and BlueBird Bio, which uses gene therapy to treat rare diseases, were among the top four biotech stocks in 2014, with 300% ascents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock\u2019s strategy has been <span class=\"s4\">\u201cbrilliant,\u201d says VC Bill Helman of <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Greylock Partners. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the few firms I\u2019ve seen in 30 years that have reinvented the model of venture capital.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The firm wouldn\u2019t exist were it not for a visit to the blackjack tables in Las Vegas. The story sounds like the setup to a cheesy joke: A finance executive and a biochemical engineer walk into a casino\u2009\u2026\u2009In this case the two men, who had grown close while working to market the multiple myeloma drug Velcade at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, were making their annual gambling pilgrimage in 2006. They commiserated over the drug industry and its loathed reputation for valuing profits over patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cThe patients are getting screwed,\u201d Kevin Starr said. \u201cWe need to do something.\u201d Now 52, Starr is a finance executive who rides a motorcycle and favors skull rings. Next to him sat Mark Levin, now 62, a biochemical engineer who worked at Eli Lilly and Genentech before joining Millennium. They soon expanded the discussion to include Robert Tepper, 59, a former oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who headed R&amp;D at Millennium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">After the three left the company, they explored new ideas. They toured academic research facilities and found what Starr calls \u201cjaw-dropping innovation.\u201d But the ideas rarely progressed beyond scholarly journals. \u201cWe said, \u2018Why is this sitting here in academia?\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Money was the reason. Biotech had a hot run in the 1990s. But by the early 2000s the costs of taking a drug to market had grown prohibitive, the odds slim. VCs mostly focused on later-stage companies or fled biotech altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996354\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=166\" alt=\"VEN-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Tepper, Starr, and Levin decided to create a firm that would conceive and build businesses from scratch. (The name was inspired by a news report that discussed the changes on Earth, the third rock from the sun\u2014not by the TV show of that name.) The trio started hiring Ph.D.s and MDs from Harvard and MIT. Many VCs scoffed, the Third Rock partners say. But by 10 weeks in, the firm had raised its first fund, $378 million. To stay focused on patients, the firm instituted a quarterly practice of inviting them to come talk about living with a rare disease or cancer. \u201cWe always cry our eyes out and get fired up to go back to the office,\u201d Starr says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Foundation Medicine was one of the first ideas to get traction. The concept was based on research by Eric Lander, a leader in the Human Genome Project and founder of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. They wondered, what if they could sell a diagnostic test that uses DNA sequencing to help determine which cancer drugs could best fight a particular patient\u2019s tumor?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock invited Lander to weekly <\/span><span class=\"s5\">brainstorming sessions along with Alexis<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> Borisy, then CEO of CombinatoRx, which uses software to match combinations of cancer drugs to treat certain tumor cells. They discussed how to scale up testing and make it affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cIt was going to be hard to do,\u201d says Borisy, who later joined Third Rock. A sequencing test then cost tens of thousands of dollars. They needed the price to sink to $2,000\u2014and they needed to persuade insurers to pay for it. For 18 months, teams from Third Rock and the Broad Institute met with experts in gene sequencing and with diagnostic companies. They talked to pharma companies, met with cancer doctors and insurers, and worked with regulators. They built models for DNA testing. \u201cIt was group genius,\u201d says Borisy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">When Foundation finally launched in 2010, Third Rock backed it with $25 million. Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins later kicked in too. The total, $40 million, far exceeded the typical $5 million to $8 million Series A biotech round. The goal: Allow the CEO to focus on growth rather than the next investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">By 2012, Borisy decided it was time for Foundation to leave the nest. He hired a CEO, and over the next two years the company rolled out two DNA-based cancer tests, collaborated with cancer centers and drug companies, and landed a $56 million investment from Bill Gates and others. In September 2013, Foundation went public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock won\u2019t disclose its returns. But according to the website of one of its investors, Calpers, its 2007 fund has generated an internal rate of return of 25.7%. That puts it well into the top performance quartile, according to alternative-investment tracker Preqin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Meanwhile the hot IPO market, along with FDA efforts to accelerate approvals for breakthrough drugs, has helped rekindle VC interest in early-stage biotech.

Early in 2014 the rookie hedge fund manager noticed something unusual: The amount of crude oil being stockpiled around the world was building much faster than normal for that time of year. The growing excess in supply wasn\u2019t yet reflected in the market, however. Benchmark oil prices continued to hover around the same lofty level they had occupied for the previous few years\u2014near or above $100 per barrel. Increasingly this was considered the new normal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Goldberg had just launched his BBL Commodities Value Fund the previous September, but he was hardly a newcomer to oil markets. He had spent the previous decade as a trader, first for Goldman Sachs and then for Swiss commodities giant Glencore. His strategy for BBL was to trade oil \u201cacross the barrel\u201d\u2014refined products as well as crude itself\u2014and to stay focused on short-term opportunities while keeping one eye on the horizon. \u201cOur views are three months, six months, maybe a year,\u201d says the 33-year-old Goldberg. \u201cAnd we<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">are very sensitive to day-to-day, week-to-week fluctuations. I\u2019ve never understood the point of putting a position on until I actually thought it was going to make money.\u201d That January he rode bullish bets on natural gas and U.S. distillate prices to a 7% monthly gain. But he began to realize that something bigger might be brewing in crude.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Goldberg and his team watched closely as the stockpiling accelerated. By the end of the first quarter, the trend was clear. A gusher of new supply driven by the stunning growth in U.S. shale oil production\u2014accounting for most of the 80% spike in overall U.S. production since the end of 2008\u2014was beginning to overwhelm demand. And yet oil prices continued to defy gravity, propelled by fears of supply disruptions. Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine and the emerging threat of a new Islamic state in northern Iraq caused crude to hit new highs in late June. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The trader stayed patient, waiting for a catalyst that would spur a drop. By the early fall Goldberg noticed that the cash prices being paid for physical oil were significantly lower than even the suddenly weakening futures prices. He became more confident that it was time to be short oil.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996187\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=345\" alt=\"INT1-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"345\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Then the bottom fell out. On Nov. 27, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that, contrary to the assumptions of much of the oil industry, it would not cut its production to defend higher prices. Crude went into free fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark for so-called light sweet crude oil, tumbled from its June high of $108 to a low in January of $44. Goldberg was well positioned for the crash. His fund made 26% in December alone and finished with a return after fees of 51.3% for the year, pushing assets up to $540 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now the question for Goldberg and others is, what happens next? What are the implications of a 50% markdown of crude\u2014in terms of cost structure, demand growth, and production? Will prices remain low for a sustained period or rebound quickly? To answer that, you have to study oil\u2019s new calculus. For the near term anyway, expect volatility, not consensus. \u201cThe only thing that there\u2019s agreement on is that it\u2019s a lot more challenging than the old math,\u201d says Dan Yergin, the vice chairman of information and analytics company IHS and the author of the essential oil-history tomes <i>The Prize<\/i> and <i>The Quest.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For most of the players in the multi-trillion-dollar oil and gas industry, crude\u2019s swift plunge has been almost as surprising as it has been costly. In November, S&amp;P Capital IQ surveyed energy professionals and asked them what they thought the price of Brent crude would be at the beginning of January: $50, $80, or $100 per barrel? The most common answer (78%) was $80; just 2% picked $50. This conviction was based on a couple of assumptions: First, that the cost of adding new production, in U.S. shale fields and elsewhere, was somewhere around $75 to $80 per barrel. Second, that Saudi Arabia, the driving force within OPEC and the shock absorber in oil markets for the past 40 years, would cut production if necessary to keep prices from falling too low.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_2.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"EasyJet Plc Passenger Jets At London Gatwick Airport Ahead Of Results\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A ground-crew worker connects a fuel hose to the wing of an Airbus aircraft.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Simon Dawson\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">Blinded by these beliefs, the industry as a whole failed to recognize what, in hindsight, should have been obvious: that a developing glut made a price correction almost inevitable\u2014especially with the Saudis signaling that they had no intention of cutting back production. \u201cThis was what they call in science an \u2018available insight,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of asset manager GMO, which oversees $120 billion, and a widely respected identifier of market imbalances of all types. Grantham laments that he, too, failed to predict the price plunge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The fallout from the drop has been swift and brutal. Publicly traded oil companies have lost billions in market value, and both public and private firms are moving aggressively to cut capital spending budgets for 2015\u2014laying off thousands of workers and shutting down hundreds of rigs. This is especially true in the new boomtowns that have powered the shale oil revolution in the U.S. (For an on-the-ground report from North Dakota oil country, see \u201cWaiting for the Reckoning.\u201d) If the downturn drags on, there will almost certainly be bankruptcies and acquisitions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a textbook implosion with regard to exploration and production capital spending domestically because the industry was leveraged to very high oil prices,\u201d says Bill Herbert, a senior researcher at Houston oil and gas investment bank Simmons &amp; Co. \u2009\u201cAnd the E&amp;P companies have been living outside of cash flow since the implosion of 2009, when the financial system essentially collapsed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Indeed, a recent paper by IHS concluded that spending on production growth in the U.S. from 2009 through 2013 had exceeded cash flow by an astounding $272 billion\u2014and at least 40% of that was raised by taking on debt. Additional credit will presumably be hard to come by. But industry observers are anticipating a wave of opportunistic investments by private equity firms. Blackstone, for instance, reportedly just raised $4.5 billion for a new fund focused on energy investments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, the industry is taking a hard look at costs. \u201cCompanies are reorienting themselves to a low-price environment,\u201d says Yergin. \u201cA decade ago they had to adjust to a higher price, and costs went way up.\u201d But even before last year\u2019s dive in prices, says Yergin, controlling costs had become the No. 1 issue for top execs at the major energy companies. \u201cIf that was a preoccupation before the price collapse, it\u2019s now an obsession,\u201d says Yergin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Even as companies move quickly into survival mode on the ground, the industry is struggling to get a handle on future prices: Will the market\u2019s corrective forces bring supply and demand back into alignment in a matter of months? Or will this be more like 1986\u2014an eerily familiar scenario in which an OPEC decision to keep pumping oil after a flood of new supply ended up tanking prices for years? After bottoming\u2014at least temporarily\u2014in late January, benchmark prices rallied in early February, with WTI reaching $53 and Brent at $62 as of presstime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But crude production continues to surge as a result of wells already drilled\u2014and stockpiles of the excess continue to grow. In early February the amount of oil in storage in the U.S., excluding the strategic petroleum reserve, reached 417 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the highest level at that time of year in at least 80 years. Barring a major disruption of supply elsewhere in the world, it\u2019s unlikely that prices will see a strong rally until those inventories begin to recede. But the slowdown in drilling should eventually put the brakes on production growth in shale. Unlike traditional onshore oilfields, which might have an annual production decline of 5% or less, shale oil wells often decline more than 50% in their first year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The oil market remains in what\u2019s known as contango\u2014with the future price of crude trading at a higher level than today\u2019s spot price. That suggests a belief that prices will rebound, at least somewhat. In mid-February, for instance, December 2017 Brent crude futures were trading above $73\u2014or about 18% higher than the spot price. This has led traders to take oil off the market\u2014in some cases by leasing supertankers for extra, floating storage capacity\u2014in hopes that they will be able to sell it back later at a higher price. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d says Chris Bake, a member of the executive committee of Vitol, the world\u2019s largest independent oil trader. \u201cWe do it here because the market is asking us to do it. It\u2019s saying, \u2018Gentlemen, we do not have a home for this oil today. Can you please take it off my hands?\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_3.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">As inventories pile up, more oil is being stored in tanks, like these in the area surrounding Cushing, Okla.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Daniel Shea<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The outlook for consumption is murky. The International Energy Agency has lowered its demand forecast several times in the past couple of years, and in a recent report cautioned that both China, the biggest demand driver, and the global economy more generally were becoming less fuel-intensive. Still, the IEA projects demand to grow by more than 7 million barrels per day over the next five years. While lower crude prices mean cheaper gasoline in the U.S., which should spur demand, that\u2019s not so much the case in other countries, where taxes represent a higher portion of the cost of gas (as in Europe).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A pair of recent reports suggest that the industry can stay in hunker-down mode for a while\u2014as long as prices don\u2019t crash much further. In January energy specialists Wood MacKenzie analyzed its database of 2,222 oil-producing fields around the world and found that a mere 0.2% of the world\u2019s supply would be operating on a cash-negative basis at $50 per barrel for Brent. At $40, the number rose to just 1.6%. And a study by IHS concluded that wells accounting for 47% of new U.S. oil production in 2014 could break even with the price of WTI below $61.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Once supply and demand come back into balance, points out Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer\u2019s senior oil analyst, prices should gravitate toward the marginal cost of production of new barrels. But where that ends up is another subject of debate. Five years ago, says Gheit, the industry needed oil at $90 to justify the development of new production of U.S. oil shale. Now that figure is significantly less, he believes, and continued technology gains will drive it lower. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this industry for 30 years,\u201d says Gheit, \u201cand I can tell you that the shale revolution has changed the calculus. In my view shale will never die. It\u2019s here to stay.\u201d He forecasts higher prices but not a return to triple digits.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Grantham has a different view. After studying oil prices over long periods, the GMO chief strategist has come to believe that there have been two major paradigm shifts when oil reset at higher baseline levels. For decades, he says, the base price, calculated in today\u2019s money, was $16. From there, oil occasionally doubled or dropped by half, but tended to return to $16. The rise of OPEC in the 1970s changed the game, says Grantham, and the baseline price jumped to $35. \u201cWhenever you were down by half, of course, it was the end of the world, it was a New World Order,\u201d says Grantham. \u201cAnd whenever you went up, the same in reverse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996202\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=527\" alt=\"INT2-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"527\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Just after the year 2000, Grantham maintains, the cost of oil inflected as f<span class=\"s3\">inding new supplies became more challenging and expensive<\/span>. That drove the base price up to $75 or $80 per barrel. Since then we have experienced both the doubling (when oil surged to nearly $150 in July 2008) and the halving (when it crashed below $40 in December 2008). Despite the gusher of U.S. shale oil production, Grantham believes that prices are likely to reset higher again\u2014to a baseline above $100\u2014because, outside of shale, finding new oil is getting harder. And there won\u2019t be enough shale production to cover the declines of existing supplies and meet future demand growth. \u201cIf you look at the size of the oilfields discovered, they get smaller and smaller at a heartbreaking rate,\u201d says Grantham. Recent data support the observation. According to IHS, nonshale discoveries have fallen sharply since 2010, and 2014 is \u201clikely to mark\u201d the first year since the 1950s that no conventional giant oilfields (those with more than 500 million barrels in reserves) were found.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">But while Grantham projects that oil will surge higher in the medium term, he ultimately\u2014perhaps 20 or 30 years down the road\u2014sees advances in technology making oil virtually obsolete in transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderfully complicated world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">As for Goldberg, he plans to stick with his process and let the market guide him. The same indicators that made him bearish on prices, he says, could signal that prices are destined to rise again. \u201cI can see a scenario where oil prices get super-bullish again if companies overcut,\u201d he says <\/span>on a recent morning, sitting in his conference room on the 38th floor of an office tower at the bottom tip of Manhattan.<span class=\"s3\"> But he\u2019s not positioned for that yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, he\u2019s staying away from big theories or bold predictions. \u201cThere\u2019s no key to the puzzle,\u201d says Goldberg, who earned a degree in economics at Yale and wrote his thesis on behavioral finance under the guidance of David Swensen, the manager of Yale\u2019s endowment. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone can sit there and figure it out. Like, \u2018Hey, oil\u2019s going to be at $50 in three years.\u2019 Well, maybe.

Inside the Boston offices of Third Rock Ventures, the partners felt the warm glow of parental pride.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock calls itself a venture capital firm, but it provides much more than funding and guidance for new enterprises. Third Rock hatched the idea for Foundation Medicine in 2008. Third Rock\u2019s team of 50 scientists and technologists designed the company\u2019s service. Third Rock drafted its business plan. The firm then infused the startup with $25 million and picked a CEO to launch it and usher it to an IPO. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock has taken this approach with nearly all of its 36 portfolio companies since its founding in 2007, and it has enjoyed other hits: Agios, which makes drugs to treat genetic disorders and cancer, and BlueBird Bio, which uses gene therapy to treat rare diseases, were among the top four biotech stocks in 2014, with 300% ascents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock\u2019s strategy has been <span class=\"s4\">\u201cbrilliant,\u201d says VC Bill Helman of <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Greylock Partners. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the few firms I\u2019ve seen in 30 years that have reinvented the model of venture capital.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The firm wouldn\u2019t exist were it not for a visit to the blackjack tables in Las Vegas. The story sounds like the setup to a cheesy joke: A finance executive and a biochemical engineer walk into a casino\u2009\u2026\u2009In this case the two men, who had grown close while working to market the multiple myeloma drug Velcade at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, were making their annual gambling pilgrimage in 2006. They commiserated over the drug industry and its loathed reputation for valuing profits over patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cThe patients are getting screwed,\u201d Kevin Starr said. \u201cWe need to do something.\u201d Now 52, Starr is a finance executive who rides a motorcycle and favors skull rings. Next to him sat Mark Levin, now 62, a biochemical engineer who worked at Eli Lilly and Genentech before joining Millennium. They soon expanded the discussion to include Robert Tepper, 59, a former oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who headed R&amp;D at Millennium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">After the three left the company, they explored new ideas. They toured academic research facilities and found what Starr calls \u201cjaw-dropping innovation.\u201d But the ideas rarely progressed beyond scholarly journals. \u201cWe said, \u2018Why is this sitting here in academia?\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Money was the reason. Biotech had a hot run in the 1990s. But by the early 2000s the costs of taking a drug to market had grown prohibitive, the odds slim. VCs mostly focused on later-stage companies or fled biotech altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996354\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=166\" alt=\"VEN-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Tepper, Starr, and Levin decided to create a firm that would conceive and build businesses from scratch. (The name was inspired by a news report that discussed the changes on Earth, the third rock from the sun\u2014not by the TV show of that name.) The trio started hiring Ph.D.s and MDs from Harvard and MIT. Many VCs scoffed, the Third Rock partners say. But by 10 weeks in, the firm had raised its first fund, $378 million. To stay focused on patients, the firm instituted a quarterly practice of inviting them to come talk about living with a rare disease or cancer. \u201cWe always cry our eyes out and get fired up to go back to the office,\u201d Starr says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Foundation Medicine was one of the first ideas to get traction. The concept was based on research by Eric Lander, a leader in the Human Genome Project and founder of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. They wondered, what if they could sell a diagnostic test that uses DNA sequencing to help determine which cancer drugs could best fight a particular patient\u2019s tumor?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock invited Lander to weekly <\/span><span class=\"s5\">brainstorming sessions along with Alexis<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> Borisy, then CEO of CombinatoRx, which uses software to match combinations of cancer drugs to treat certain tumor cells. They discussed how to scale up testing and make it affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cIt was going to be hard to do,\u201d says Borisy, who later joined Third Rock. A sequencing test then cost tens of thousands of dollars. They needed the price to sink to $2,000\u2014and they needed to persuade insurers to pay for it. For 18 months, teams from Third Rock and the Broad Institute met with experts in gene sequencing and with diagnostic companies. They talked to pharma companies, met with cancer doctors and insurers, and worked with regulators. They built models for DNA testing. \u201cIt was group genius,\u201d says Borisy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">When Foundation finally launched in 2010, Third Rock backed it with $25 million. Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins later kicked in too. The total, $40 million, far exceeded the typical $5 million to $8 million Series A biotech round. The goal: Allow the CEO to focus on growth rather than the next investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">By 2012, Borisy decided it was time for Foundation to leave the nest. He hired a CEO, and over the next two years the company rolled out two DNA-based cancer tests, collaborated with cancer centers and drug companies, and landed a $56 million investment from Bill Gates and others. In September 2013, Foundation went public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock won\u2019t disclose its returns. But according to the website of one of its investors, Calpers, its 2007 fund has generated an internal rate of return of 25.7%. That puts it well into the top performance quartile, according to alternative-investment tracker Preqin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Meanwhile the hot IPO market, along with FDA efforts to accelerate approvals for breakthrough drugs, has helped rekindle VC interest in early-stage biotech. For Starr, the goal is to reach more cancer patients. \u201cFor us, these aren\u2019t investments,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s validation that our babies are coming into adolescence.\u201d\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"7\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4066655983001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066655983001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1CFLddY\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dnewyorkfashionweek%2Cnike%2Cnikesacai%2Cniketeamingupwithsacai%2Cnikewomensapparel%2Cnikewomensclothing%2Cnyfw%2Csacai%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dnike&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 09:30:06","updated":"2015-02-19 09:30:06","minute":"9:30 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Third Rock Ventures: Giving birth to a new generation of biotechs","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven01_1.jpg?quality=80&w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Photograph by Brad DeCecco for Fortune Magazine","caption":"From left: Mark Levin, Robert Tepper, and Kevin Starr of Third Rock Ventures","attach_id":996311},"excerpt":"Third Rock is more than a venture capital firm.

Investors fretted that the social media company wasn\u2019t making enough money from mobile ads. Regulators pressed the company on its mobile-revenue guidance, which proved controversial. On the big day, technical glitches at Nasdaq delayed the listing, creating mass confusion among traders. The stock closed at $38.23, up less than 1% from where it was priced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The IPO of Twitter <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TWTR\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/twtr\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TWTR<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Facebook\u2019s competitor for eyeballs and ad dollars, couldn\u2019t have been more different. When Twitter went public in November 2013, the offering proceeded flawlessly, and its stock ended at $44.90, up 73%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">What happened next proves that for all the fuss over IPOs, they say very little about a company\u2019s value or its future stock price. After a rocky first year, Facebook\u2019s stock climbed precipitously, trading recently at $76. It earned almost $3 billion in profits last year. Its top executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, remain the toast of the technology industry. In contrast, Wall Street quickly soured on Twitter after its model IPO: Its shares, after rising 282% from its offering price, are back where they started. The investing commentariat has called for CEO Dick Costolo\u2019s head; CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said Twitter has an \u201cABC situation\u201d\u2014as in \u201cAnybody but Costolo.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec03_1.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996332\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec03_1.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=452&#038;h=650\" alt=\"Twitter Facebook\" width=\"452\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><em><span class=\"credit\">Illustration by Nigel Buchanan for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">For investors, perception always has been as big a factor as fundamentals. But the inverse narratives of the Facebook and Twitter IPOs show that over time, performance talks and buzz fades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Facebook did have a problem with its mobile business in 2012. At the time of its IPO, Facebook generated no meaningful revenue from its rapidly growing pool of mobile -users. Today the company has fixed it convincingly: Mobile represented two-thirds of Facebook\u2019s $12.5 billion in revenue last year. An aggressive turnaround was more meaningful to investors than the technical failings of the exchange on which it chose to trade its shares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996426\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=168\" alt=\"TEC-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Twitter\u2019s IPO may have gone smoothly, but problems began to pile up soon afterward. Despite rapidly accelerating revenue, the rate that Twitter added monthly active users slowed\u2014less than 4%, to 241 million, in its first quarter as a public company, and as low as 1.4% in a recent quarter\u2014worrying investors that Twitter might not be the mainstream product that its soaring valuation promised. (Just 36% of Twitter users access it daily, according to Pew, well below the 70% for Facebook.) The departure of top executives in 2014\u2014COO Ali Rowghani, CFO Mike Gupta, and several vice presidents\u2014further spooked investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Worst of all, Twitter has failed to clearly define what it is. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Dick Costolo use characterizations that were anywhere from a town square to a series of concentric circles,\u201d says Scott Kessler, an analyst with S&amp;P Capital IQ. \u201cThere\u2019s confusion inside and outside of the company on whether it\u2019s a tech or media company.\u201d Much like turnaround-mode Yahoo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Twitter may finally be pulling itself together.

If he couldn\u2019t reach a $1 billion valuation for Slack, his San Francisco business software company, he wouldn\u2019t bother. Slack was hardly starving for cash. It was a rocket ship, with thousands of people signing up for its workplace collaboration tools each week. What Slack needed, Butterfield believed, was the cachet of the billion-dollar mark.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, it\u2019s arbitrary because it\u2019s a big round number,\u201d says Butterfield, 41. \u201cIt does make a difference psychologically. One billion is better than $800 million because it\u2019s the psychological threshold for potential customers, employees, and the press.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/unicorn_final_full-1.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Unicorn cover horizontal\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Illustration by Jeremy Enecio for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure enough, in October\u2014less than a year after the company released its namesake product\u2014Slack announced the close of a $120 million round of financing. Its valuation? One billion dollars. Butterfield\u2019s wish had come true: Slack was the tech world\u2019s newest \u201cunicorn.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It wasn\u2019t long ago that the idea of a pre-IPO tech startup with a $1 billion market value was a fantasy. Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"GOOG\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/goog\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">GOOG<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> was never worth $1 billion as a private company. Neither was Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/amzn\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> nor any other alumnus of the original dotcom class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Today the technology industry is crowded with billion-dollar startups. When Cowboy Ventures founder Aileen Lee <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/11\/02\/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club\/\">coined the term unicorn<\/a> as a label for such corporate creatures in a November 2013 TechCrunch blog post, just 39 of the past decade\u2019s VC-backed U.S. software startups had topped the $1 billion valuation mark. Now, casting a wider net, <i>Fortune<\/i> counts more than 80 startups that have been valued at $1 billion or more by venture capitalists (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/unicorns\">full list here<\/a>). And given that these companies are privately held, a few are sure to have escaped our detection. The rise of the unicorn has occurred rapidly and without much warning, and it\u2019s starting to freak some people out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt used to be that unicorns were these mythical creatures,\u201d says Jason Green, a venture capitalist at Emergence Capital Partners whose investments include Yammer, which sold to Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"MSFT\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/msft\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">MSFT<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> for $1.2 billion. \u201cNow there are herds of unicorns.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Not content to run with the pack\u2014or \u201cblessing,\u201d as a group of unicorns is sometimes known\u2014venture capitalists have begun targeting even bigger game. They\u2019re now hunting startups with the potential to rapidly reach a $10 billion valuation\u2014or, as Green calls them, \u201cdecacorns.\u201d In late 2013 just one private company had crossed that threshold: Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"FB\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/fb\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">FB<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. Now there are at least eight, including Uber, the on-demand car service worth $41.2 billion. Its valuation is higher than the market capitalization of at least 70% of the companies in the <a href=\"fortune.com\/fortune500\">Fortune 500<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Technology is driving the boom. Smartphones, cheap sensors, and cloud computing have enabled <span class=\"s2\">a raft of new Internet-connected services that are infiltrating the most tech-averse industries\u2014Uber is roiling the taxi industry; Airbnb is disrupting hotels. Investors see massive opportunity in the upheaval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then there are the broader financial trends. A nearly six-year-old raging bull market in public <span class=\"s1\">stocks has produced a tailwind for private company valuations and convinced the latest crop of tech entrepreneurs that there will be plenty of time to cash in when they feel like it. Record-low interest rates also have caused some big institutional investors to search for returns in the high-risk, high-reward world of venture capital. Add to that a lack of regulation: After the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, which aimed to make it easier for small businesses to raise capital, startups could take on many more investors before the Securities and Exchange Commission effectively forced them to go public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Finally, there is the intangible element of <\/span><span class=\"s1\">perception. In the startup world, a valuation of $1 billion says that you\u2019re no longer a fly-by-night startup with plans to quickly sell out to Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt absolutely gives us credibility and the ability to hire some very important people,\u201d says Apoorva Mehta, the 28-year-old CEO of on-demand grocery delivery service Instacart, which has been in business for only two years but reportedly is valued at $2 billion. \u201cAnd it tells the world that we\u2019re looking to build a long-lasting worldwide brand instead of looking to get acquired.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Venture capitalists justify these soaring valuations by looking backward. After the dotcom crash, a wave of prudence swept over the Valley. Investors kept valuations low and tried not to overcapitalize their companies. That strategy lasted until Hurricane Facebook came along. All of the cautious types who passed on investing in the social network early, because it was too expensive at $250 million or $500 million, were left scarred and paranoid when it went public in May 2012 with a market cap of $104 billion. If a startup is going to be worth billions of dollars in a few years, why quibble over a few million on the entry price?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a result, the median valuation of a Series A round of funding soared 135% between 2012 and 2014, according to the law firm Cooley LLP. This has created an echo effect, with new gains setting the bar higher for each subsequent round of funding. So venture capitalists have recruited unlikely new partners in the form of traditional money managers such as Fidelity Investments (which led the latest deal for Uber) and Wellington Management (which backed DocuSign and Moderna Therapeutics) to support unicorn-level rounds. Call it trickle-up economics. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It also doesn\u2019t hurt that American corporations have record-breaking stockpiles of cash on their balance sheets. Facebook set tongues wagging when it paid $19 billion for instant-messaging startup WhatsApp last March, then followed it up a month later by shelling out $2 billion for virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR. In 2014, Google paid $3.2 billion for smart thermostat maker Nest, Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/aapl\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> acquired headphone maker Beats for $3 billion, and Microsoft spent $2.5 billion to own the Swedish gaming startup responsible for <i>Minecraft<\/i>. Even health care VCs cashed in, selling Seragon Pharmaceuticals to Genentech for upwards of $1.7 billion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/uni-02-011.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-958900 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/uni-02-011.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=1024&#038;h=529\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em style=\"font-size:11px;\">(Click thumbnail to see full graphic)<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All of this has begun to feel bubblicious, especially to those who lived through the last cycle. \u201cIf you are a CEO today and you\u2019re age 35 or below, you did not go through 2000, which means you have not actually seen the capital markets shut off,\u201d says venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who nonetheless remains bullish. \u201cPeople who went through 2000 are psychologically scarred and arguably have been risk-averse for the last 15 years. If you didn\u2019t go through it you\u2019re in danger of always believing you can raise money at a higher valuation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Greycroft Partners founder Alan Patricof, who has been investing in startups for more than four decades, is wary. \u201cPeople are buying traffic growth and revenue growth, but it\u2019s the \u2018emperor has no clothes\u2019 theory,\u201d he says. \u201cAt some point all of these companies will be valued on a multiple of Ebitda. If the IPO market goes away, or for any reason there\u2019s a blip in the outlook, people could be left holding a lot of inventory they wish they didn\u2019t have.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Proponents of the unicorn boom posit that this time\u2014no, seriously!\u2014is different. Many of the billion-dollar startups, they argue, have the actual customers and revenue that companies of the dotcom days lacked. But no one in the VC world is so sanguine as to suggest that, sooner or later, we won\u2019t experience a market pullback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Not surprisingly, many venture capitalists have begun preaching caution to their portfolio companies. A brief swoon in publicly traded tech stock prices last April\u2014particularly in the enterprise sector\u2014was seen industrywide as a warning shot that startups should control their \u201cburn rates\u201d and raise as much new money as possible to protect against a future funding drought. Entrepreneurs listened, at least to the second part: U.S.-based companies raised more venture capital in the fourth quarter of 2014 than they did in any other quarter over the prior 13 years, according to the National Venture Capital Association.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That explains, in part, why a company like Instacart raised $120 million in new funding earlier this month at its reported $2 billion valuation just six months after raising $44 million at a $400 million valuation. Or why social media company Pinterest raised $625 million over three rounds of funding between February 2013 and May 2014, doubling its valuation from $2.5 billion to $5 billion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But more aggressive fundraising is no guarantee that unicorns will grow into their valuations. \u201cGoing from $0 to $50 million in revenue is a lot different from going from $50 million to several hundred million,\u201d says Green. \u201cA lot of folks don\u2019t make that transition. Most don\u2019t. Maybe half of those companies won\u2019t fulfill their potential.\u201d (For a look at a startup struggling to break through, read the story on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/22\/jawbone\/\">Jawbone<\/a>.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Several unicorns have already experienced a pullback. Open-<span class=\"s1\">source software company Horton<\/span>works <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"HDP\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/hdp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">HDP<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> was valued at $1 billion by private investors but lowered its market cap to $666 million when it went public last December. (It has since crossed back over the $1 billion mark in market value.) Box, the data storage company credited with making enterprise technology cool, was preparing to hold an IPO just days after this magazine went to press. Its initial valuation was expected to be at least 30% lower than the $2.4 billion it commanded from private investors like TPG Capital last summer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">And then there is Fab, the <\/span><span class=\"s1\">design-focused e-commerce site that said it would generate $250 million in revenue in 2013. It ended up bringing in around $100 million. (At one point, it burned as much as $14 million per month.) Fab shrank from 750 employees to 150, and CEO Jason Goldberg repositioned the company as a custom furniture business. Fab was widely reported to have raised some of its $336 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation, but Goldberg acknowledges to <i>Fortune<\/i> that its valuation never actually topped $875 million. He acknowledges the company isn\u2019t worth close to that today. \u201cIf you allow yourself to believe you\u2019re worth $1 billion after two to three years of being in business, you\u2019re going to get yourself caught up in trouble,\u201d Goldberg says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Even in the best of times, of course, startup investing is high risk. As quickly as the Age of Unicorns arrived, the conditions that created it could reverse and leave entrepreneurs and investors wistful for what might have been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a lot of failure in 2015,\u201d says Benchmark Capital partner Bill Gurley, who sits on Uber\u2019s board of directors. \u201cIf you\u2019re a public company worth $3 billion and your stock trades down to $1 billion, you can survive it because you can still issue options to hire new employees, etc. \u2009If it happens when you\u2019re private, though, it becomes immediately harder to hire or to get incremental investment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In the meantime, expect more billion-dollar startups to emerge\u2014at least for now. \u201cYou can\u2019t choose not to play,\u201d Gurley says. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the enterprise segment and your competitors are raising $150 million at high valuations and pouring it into sales, you either can do something similar or be conservative and no longer matter.\u201d Which might explain why some VCs continue to invest even as they predict failure. There\u2019s always the hope and belief that the value created by a few successful unicorns will offset the losses of those that fail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Butterfield knows the easy venture money will dry up at some point. It\u2019s one reason Slack has spent only 1% of the money it\u2019s raised. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be in a meteors-hitting-the-Earth scenario before Slack as a business would get into trouble,\u201d he boasts.

He was among the first to foresee large software programs moving to the \u201ccloud\u201d\u2014 a concept he played a large role in popularizing\u2014referring to inexpensively rented software sitting remotely on a network rather than on its owner\u2019s computer.

Edited excerpts:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What\u2019s the most important trend you see right now in the technology industry? <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We\u2019re in an AI spring.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You mean artificial intelligence?<\/b><\/span><b> <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes. For our company, and I think for every company, the revolution in data science will fundamentally change how we run our business because we\u2019re going to have computers aiding us in how we\u2019re interacting with our customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/ben02_1.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">To stay stimulated, Benioff likes to be around creative people. \u201cThat\u2019s a way that I ideate.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Dan Escobar<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What\u2019s an example of a company that\u2019s using data well?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You probably don\u2019t have to go very much further than looking at Uber and asking, \u201cWhy would Uber have all these data scientists?\u201d Well, they want to have trip optimization, and they want to be able to maximize the efficiency of their fleet and ultimately provide you with the best customer service. And they think they\u2019re going to do all that through data.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What does that mean for an executive without a background in computers, like you? <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Based on the simple fact that there\u2019s just a huge amount more data than ever before, our greatest challenge is making sense of that data. And we need a new generation of tools to be able to organize and view the data. We need a new generation of executives who understand how to manage and lead through data. And we also need a new generation of employees who are able to help us organize and structure our businesses around that data. When I look at the next set of technologies that we have to build in Salesforce, it\u2019s all data-science-based technology. We don\u2019t need more cloud. We don\u2019t need more mobile. We don\u2019t need more social. We need more data science. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How confident are you that nonexperts can consume this data?<\/b><\/span><b> <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Very.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because the whole concept of data science is that the software becomes the expert, and you as the average user are able to understand what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Where do your ideas come from?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I like to be around creative people. That\u2019s a way that I ideate. I like to be in locations that I kind of feel are very creative, that stimulate me in a creative process. I also get a lot of stimulation being around my customers. The next stage of my creative process is I start to ask myself the right questions. I think the quality of your innovation is directly proportional to the quality of your questions. And I think that I\u2019m constantly asking myself and my team questions to kind of give us clarity on what the future should look like. And I think that helps create a vision. And once you start to create a vision, you start to create a framework of creativity, and ideas come out of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>History suggests that big companies have a very tough time staying on top. How do you approach that as the CEO of a 16-year-old technology company worth $36 billion?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To quote Andy Grove, \u201cOnly the paranoid survive.\u201d You have to be ready to have a beginner\u2019s mind and constantly be creating the future. Always be ready to start again. And don\u2019t be afraid to throw everything away and restart. I think that\u2019s what you see in people like Neil Young who are not singing the same songs they were. I mean, he\u2019s still singing \u201cHeart of Gold\u201d and \u201cOld Man,\u201d but he\u2019s also writing new songs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>You\u2019re an angel investor in startups like Fitbit, ZocDoc, and Hampton Creek. Why do you spend time on such investments?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I really try to stay in touch with all the new things that are coming, the entrepreneurs, what\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s been a way for me to stay in touch with the transformations that are happening in the industry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Are valuations of these companies out of whack?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it\u2019s really hard to tell right now. I think that for sure the valuations are getting really inflated. I think Warren Buffett said, \u201cWhen others are greedy, become fearful. And when others are fearful, become greedy.\u201d That\u2019s a good phrase to kind of put on some of these right now. That said, some of them are certainly warranted. You see massive acceleration in revenue on some of these companies. Airbnb and Uber are two great examples. Those are companies that have multibillion-dollar revenue streams and that are growing. When the companies with the tens of millions of dollars of revenue start to reach out for those huge valuations, that\u2019s when I think we get into trouble. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting to right now. There\u2019s a company that I invested in with security technology, maybe only six or nine months ago at some eight-digit valuation, and six months later it has a nine-digit valuation. I don\u2019t completely understand that. I worry mostly that it defocuses the entrepreneurs away from creating great businesses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What\u2019s the state of play in cyberterrorism?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, if you go to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marc_Benioff\">my Wikipedia page<\/a>, you\u2019ll see at the bottom there\u2019s a report that I wrote in 2004 called \u201cCybersecurity and Crisis Prioritization.\u201d I wrote that for George W. Bush. And you\u2019ll see that we still have a crisis of prioritization regarding cybersecurity because cybersecurity is an oxymoron. And we built an Internet that was inherently insecure and unreliable. That was the nature of the Internet itself when it was built and designed in the \u201960s. So there is no finish line when it comes to cybersecurity. Everybody should have security as his or her No. 1 priority because we are in a highly dynamic environment. That is not going to change. By the way, I have zero arrogance when it comes to cybersecurity. I am paranoid all the time because I see all the things that are happening, and I am completely worried every single day about security, and everybody should be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>How did Salesforce.com become so chummy with Microsoft, a sworn enemy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I was at a dinner with Satya Nadella down at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. And Satya was talking about what he is trying to achieve with the company and how he wants to be more collaborative. So I decided to test him. I told him I wanted to hire one of his technologists as head of our infrastructure. What would be in it for Microsoft is the foundation of a partnership that would give us more kinds of ideas of things that we can do together. And he said okay. Now we\u2019re learning about things that we could do with Microsoft\u2019s file-management technologies and Office that we would never have known on our own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>And you think that couldn\u2019t have happened without Nadella?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other guy [former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer] did not care about having a relationship with Salesforce. In fact, he kind of did everything he could to not have a relationship with Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Salesforce\u2019s revenues are big and growing fast, but the company is not profitable. Do you feel it\u2019s important to produce some net income soon?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have a huge market opportunity in front of us, so growth continues to be a top priority. No other top 10 software company is growing faster than Salesforce. As we take advantage of this growth opportunity, we are also improving profit margins. You can see that in our numbers this year, and we\u2019re committed to continuing the trend next year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Switching to philanthropy, do you feel that the current crop of tech entrepreneurs lacks your sense of civic responsibility?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, I think that\u2019s the whole history of the tech industry. We have an industry that has a history of stinginess and that does not have a good history of giving back. I\u2019ve been on my soapbox in trying to get these entrepreneurs to listen to me. And all I want them to know is that it\u2019s an option. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s kind of like when I said to you that the quality of your leadership is the quality of your questions. Just asking them the questions\u2014\u201cWell, what are you doing philanthropically with your company? And what are you doing personally with philanthropy?\u201d\u2014is enough.\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the February 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"January 22, 2015","published":"2015-01-22 08:00:43","updated":"2015-01-22 08:00:43","minute":"8:00 AM EST","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/22\/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-on-where-big-tech-is-headed\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/22\/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-on-where-big-tech-is-headed\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/22\/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-on-where-big-tech-is-headed\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on where big tech is headed","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/ben02_1.jpg?quality=80&w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Photograph by Dan Escobar","caption":"To stay stimulated, Benioff likes to be around creative people. \u201cThat\u2019s a way that I ideate.\u201d","attach_id":954794},"excerpt":"We\u2019re in the early stages of a data-science revolution, says Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff.","authors":[{"id":"381316","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/adam-lashinsky\/","name":"Adam Lashinsky","twitter":"adamlashinsky","gplus":"","email":"adam_lashinsky@fortune.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/lashinsky-adam-new2.jpg?quality=80&amp;w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"WRITER HEADSHOTS \u2014 Adam Lashinsky headshot\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/lashinsky-adam-new2.jpg?quality=80&w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Adam Lashinsky joined FORTUNE in 2001 and is the author of the 2012 bestseller Inside Apple.

Investors fretted that the social media company wasn\u2019t making enough money from mobile ads. Regulators pressed the company on its mobile-revenue guidance, which proved controversial. On the big day, technical glitches at Nasdaq delayed the listing, creating mass confusion among traders. The stock closed at $38.23, up less than 1% from where it was priced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The IPO of Twitter <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TWTR\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/twtr\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TWTR<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Facebook\u2019s competitor for eyeballs and ad dollars, couldn\u2019t have been more different. When Twitter went public in November 2013, the offering proceeded flawlessly, and its stock ended at $44.90, up 73%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">What happened next proves that for all the fuss over IPOs, they say very little about a company\u2019s value or its future stock price. After a rocky first year, Facebook\u2019s stock climbed precipitously, trading recently at $76. It earned almost $3 billion in profits last year. Its top executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, remain the toast of the technology industry. In contrast, Wall Street quickly soured on Twitter after its model IPO: Its shares, after rising 282% from its offering price, are back where they started. The investing commentariat has called for CEO Dick Costolo\u2019s head; CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said Twitter has an \u201cABC situation\u201d\u2014as in \u201cAnybody but Costolo.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec03_1.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996332\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec03_1.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=452&#038;h=650\" alt=\"Twitter Facebook\" width=\"452\" height=\"650\" \/><\/a><em><span class=\"credit\">Illustration by Nigel Buchanan for Fortune<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">For investors, perception always has been as big a factor as fundamentals. But the inverse narratives of the Facebook and Twitter IPOs show that over time, performance talks and buzz fades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Facebook did have a problem with its mobile business in 2012. At the time of its IPO, Facebook generated no meaningful revenue from its rapidly growing pool of mobile -users. Today the company has fixed it convincingly: Mobile represented two-thirds of Facebook\u2019s $12.5 billion in revenue last year. An aggressive turnaround was more meaningful to investors than the technical failings of the exchange on which it chose to trade its shares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996426\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/tec-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=168\" alt=\"TEC-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Twitter\u2019s IPO may have gone smoothly, but problems began to pile up soon afterward. Despite rapidly accelerating revenue, the rate that Twitter added monthly active users slowed\u2014less than 4%, to 241 million, in its first quarter as a public company, and as low as 1.4% in a recent quarter\u2014worrying investors that Twitter might not be the mainstream product that its soaring valuation promised. (Just 36% of Twitter users access it daily, according to Pew, well below the 70% for Facebook.)

Early in 2014 the rookie hedge fund manager noticed something unusual: The amount of crude oil being stockpiled around the world was building much faster than normal for that time of year. The growing excess in supply wasn\u2019t yet reflected in the market, however. Benchmark oil prices continued to hover around the same lofty level they had occupied for the previous few years\u2014near or above $100 per barrel. Increasingly this was considered the new normal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Goldberg had just launched his BBL Commodities Value Fund the previous September, but he was hardly a newcomer to oil markets. He had spent the previous decade as a trader, first for Goldman Sachs and then for Swiss commodities giant Glencore. His strategy for BBL was to trade oil \u201cacross the barrel\u201d\u2014refined products as well as crude itself\u2014and to stay focused on short-term opportunities while keeping one eye on the horizon. \u201cOur views are three months, six months, maybe a year,\u201d says the 33-year-old Goldberg. \u201cAnd we<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">are very sensitive to day-to-day, week-to-week fluctuations. I\u2019ve never understood the point of putting a position on until I actually thought it was going to make money.\u201d That January he rode bullish bets on natural gas and U.S. distillate prices to a 7% monthly gain. But he began to realize that something bigger might be brewing in crude.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Goldberg and his team watched closely as the stockpiling accelerated. By the end of the first quarter, the trend was clear. A gusher of new supply driven by the stunning growth in U.S. shale oil production\u2014accounting for most of the 80% spike in overall U.S. production since the end of 2008\u2014was beginning to overwhelm demand. And yet oil prices continued to defy gravity, propelled by fears of supply disruptions. Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine and the emerging threat of a new Islamic state in northern Iraq caused crude to hit new highs in late June. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The trader stayed patient, waiting for a catalyst that would spur a drop. By the early fall Goldberg noticed that the cash prices being paid for physical oil were significantly lower than even the suddenly weakening futures prices. He became more confident that it was time to be short oil.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996187\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int1-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=345\" alt=\"INT1-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"345\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Then the bottom fell out. On Nov. 27, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that, contrary to the assumptions of much of the oil industry, it would not cut its production to defend higher prices. Crude went into free fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark for so-called light sweet crude oil, tumbled from its June high of $108 to a low in January of $44. Goldberg was well positioned for the crash. His fund made 26% in December alone and finished with a return after fees of 51.3% for the year, pushing assets up to $540 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Now the question for Goldberg and others is, what happens next? What are the implications of a 50% markdown of crude\u2014in terms of cost structure, demand growth, and production? Will prices remain low for a sustained period or rebound quickly? To answer that, you have to study oil\u2019s new calculus. For the near term anyway, expect volatility, not consensus. \u201cThe only thing that there\u2019s agreement on is that it\u2019s a lot more challenging than the old math,\u201d says Dan Yergin, the vice chairman of information and analytics company IHS and the author of the essential oil-history tomes <i>The Prize<\/i> and <i>The Quest.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For most of the players in the multi-trillion-dollar oil and gas industry, crude\u2019s swift plunge has been almost as surprising as it has been costly. In November, S&amp;P Capital IQ surveyed energy professionals and asked them what they thought the price of Brent crude would be at the beginning of January: $50, $80, or $100 per barrel? The most common answer (78%) was $80; just 2% picked $50. This conviction was based on a couple of assumptions: First, that the cost of adding new production, in U.S. shale fields and elsewhere, was somewhere around $75 to $80 per barrel. Second, that Saudi Arabia, the driving force within OPEC and the shock absorber in oil markets for the past 40 years, would cut production if necessary to keep prices from falling too low.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_2.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"EasyJet Plc Passenger Jets At London Gatwick Airport Ahead Of Results\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A ground-crew worker connects a fuel hose to the wing of an Airbus aircraft.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Simon Dawson\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">Blinded by these beliefs, the industry as a whole failed to recognize what, in hindsight, should have been obvious: that a developing glut made a price correction almost inevitable\u2014especially with the Saudis signaling that they had no intention of cutting back production. \u201cThis was what they call in science an \u2018available insight,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of asset manager GMO, which oversees $120 billion, and a widely respected identifier of market imbalances of all types. Grantham laments that he, too, failed to predict the price plunge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The fallout from the drop has been swift and brutal. Publicly traded oil companies have lost billions in market value, and both public and private firms are moving aggressively to cut capital spending budgets for 2015\u2014laying off thousands of workers and shutting down hundreds of rigs. This is especially true in the new boomtowns that have powered the shale oil revolution in the U.S. (For an on-the-ground report from North Dakota oil country, see \u201cWaiting for the Reckoning.\u201d) If the downturn drags on, there will almost certainly be bankruptcies and acquisitions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a textbook implosion with regard to exploration and production capital spending domestically because the industry was leveraged to very high oil prices,\u201d says Bill Herbert, a senior researcher at Houston oil and gas investment bank Simmons &amp; Co. \u2009\u201cAnd the E&amp;P companies have been living outside of cash flow since the implosion of 2009, when the financial system essentially collapsed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Indeed, a recent paper by IHS concluded that spending on production growth in the U.S. from 2009 through 2013 had exceeded cash flow by an astounding $272 billion\u2014and at least 40% of that was raised by taking on debt. Additional credit will presumably be hard to come by. But industry observers are anticipating a wave of opportunistic investments by private equity firms. Blackstone, for instance, reportedly just raised $4.5 billion for a new fund focused on energy investments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, the industry is taking a hard look at costs. \u201cCompanies are reorienting themselves to a low-price environment,\u201d says Yergin. \u201cA decade ago they had to adjust to a higher price, and costs went way up.\u201d But even before last year\u2019s dive in prices, says Yergin, controlling costs had become the No. 1 issue for top execs at the major energy companies. \u201cIf that was a preoccupation before the price collapse, it\u2019s now an obsession,\u201d says Yergin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Even as companies move quickly into survival mode on the ground, the industry is struggling to get a handle on future prices: Will the market\u2019s corrective forces bring supply and demand back into alignment in a matter of months? Or will this be more like 1986\u2014an eerily familiar scenario in which an OPEC decision to keep pumping oil after a flood of new supply ended up tanking prices for years? After bottoming\u2014at least temporarily\u2014in late January, benchmark prices rallied in early February, with WTI reaching $53 and Brent at $62 as of presstime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But crude production continues to surge as a result of wells already drilled\u2014and stockpiles of the excess continue to grow. In early February the amount of oil in storage in the U.S., excluding the strategic petroleum reserve, reached 417 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the highest level at that time of year in at least 80 years. Barring a major disruption of supply elsewhere in the world, it\u2019s unlikely that prices will see a strong rally until those inventories begin to recede. But the slowdown in drilling should eventually put the brakes on production growth in shale. Unlike traditional onshore oilfields, which might have an annual production decline of 5% or less, shale oil wells often decline more than 50% in their first year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The oil market remains in what\u2019s known as contango\u2014with the future price of crude trading at a higher level than today\u2019s spot price. That suggests a belief that prices will rebound, at least somewhat. In mid-February, for instance, December 2017 Brent crude futures were trading above $73\u2014or about 18% higher than the spot price. This has led traders to take oil off the market\u2014in some cases by leasing supertankers for extra, floating storage capacity\u2014in hopes that they will be able to sell it back later at a higher price. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d says Chris Bake, a member of the executive committee of Vitol, the world\u2019s largest independent oil trader. \u201cWe do it here because the market is asking us to do it. It\u2019s saying, \u2018Gentlemen, we do not have a home for this oil today. Can you please take it off my hands?\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int03_3.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">As inventories pile up, more oil is being stored in tanks, like these in the area surrounding Cushing, Okla.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Daniel Shea<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The outlook for consumption is murky. The International Energy Agency has lowered its demand forecast several times in the past couple of years, and in a recent report cautioned that both China, the biggest demand driver, and the global economy more generally were becoming less fuel-intensive. Still, the IEA projects demand to grow by more than 7 million barrels per day over the next five years. While lower crude prices mean cheaper gasoline in the U.S., which should spur demand, that\u2019s not so much the case in other countries, where taxes represent a higher portion of the cost of gas (as in Europe).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">A pair of recent reports suggest that the industry can stay in hunker-down mode for a while\u2014as long as prices don\u2019t crash much further. In January energy specialists Wood MacKenzie analyzed its database of 2,222 oil-producing fields around the world and found that a mere 0.2% of the world\u2019s supply would be operating on a cash-negative basis at $50 per barrel for Brent. At $40, the number rose to just 1.6%. And a study by IHS concluded that wells accounting for 47% of new U.S. oil production in 2014 could break even with the price of WTI below $61.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Once supply and demand come back into balance, points out Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer\u2019s senior oil analyst, prices should gravitate toward the marginal cost of production of new barrels. But where that ends up is another subject of debate. Five years ago, says Gheit, the industry needed oil at $90 to justify the development of new production of U.S. oil shale. Now that figure is significantly less, he believes, and continued technology gains will drive it lower. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this industry for 30 years,\u201d says Gheit, \u201cand I can tell you that the shale revolution has changed the calculus. In my view shale will never die. It\u2019s here to stay.\u201d He forecasts higher prices but not a return to triple digits.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Grantham has a different view. After studying oil prices over long periods, the GMO chief strategist has come to believe that there have been two major paradigm shifts when oil reset at higher baseline levels. For decades, he says, the base price, calculated in today\u2019s money, was $16. From there, oil occasionally doubled or dropped by half, but tended to return to $16. The rise of OPEC in the 1970s changed the game, says Grantham, and the baseline price jumped to $35. \u201cWhenever you were down by half, of course, it was the end of the world, it was a New World Order,\u201d says Grantham. \u201cAnd whenever you went up, the same in reverse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996202\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/int2-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=527\" alt=\"INT2-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"527\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Just after the year 2000, Grantham maintains, the cost of oil inflected as f<span class=\"s3\">inding new supplies became more challenging and expensive<\/span>. That drove the base price up to $75 or $80 per barrel. Since then we have experienced both the doubling (when oil surged to nearly $150 in July 2008) and the halving (when it crashed below $40 in December 2008). Despite the gusher of U.S. shale oil production, Grantham believes that prices are likely to reset higher again\u2014to a baseline above $100\u2014because, outside of shale, finding new oil is getting harder. And there won\u2019t be enough shale production to cover the declines of existing supplies and meet future demand growth. \u201cIf you look at the size of the oilfields discovered, they get smaller and smaller at a heartbreaking rate,\u201d says Grantham. Recent data support the observation. According to IHS, nonshale discoveries have fallen sharply since 2010, and 2014 is \u201clikely to mark\u201d the first year since the 1950s that no conventional giant oilfields (those with more than 500 million barrels in reserves) were found.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">But while Grantham projects that oil will surge higher in the medium term, he ultimately\u2014perhaps 20 or 30 years down the road\u2014sees advances in technology making oil virtually obsolete in transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderfully complicated world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">As for Goldberg, he plans to stick with his process and let the market guide him. The same indicators that made him bearish on prices, he says, could signal that prices are destined to rise again. \u201cI can see a scenario where oil prices get super-bullish again if companies overcut,\u201d he says <\/span>on a recent morning, sitting in his conference room on the 38th floor of an office tower at the bottom tip of Manhattan.<span class=\"s3\"> But he\u2019s not positioned for that yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, he\u2019s staying away from big theories or bold predictions. \u201cThere\u2019s no key to the puzzle,\u201d says Goldberg, who earned a degree in economics at Yale and wrote his thesis on behavioral finance under the guidance of David Swensen, the manager of Yale\u2019s endowment. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone can sit there and figure it out. Like, \u2018Hey, oil\u2019s going to be at $50 in three years.\u2019 Well, maybe.

Inside the Boston offices of Third Rock Ventures, the partners felt the warm glow of parental pride.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock calls itself a venture capital firm, but it provides much more than funding and guidance for new enterprises. Third Rock hatched the idea for Foundation Medicine in 2008. Third Rock\u2019s team of 50 scientists and technologists designed the company\u2019s service. Third Rock drafted its business plan. The firm then infused the startup with $25 million and picked a CEO to launch it and usher it to an IPO. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock has taken this approach with nearly all of its 36 portfolio companies since its founding in 2007, and it has enjoyed other hits: Agios, which makes drugs to treat genetic disorders and cancer, and BlueBird Bio, which uses gene therapy to treat rare diseases, were among the top four biotech stocks in 2014, with 300% ascents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Third Rock\u2019s strategy has been <span class=\"s4\">\u201cbrilliant,\u201d says VC Bill Helman of <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Greylock Partners. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the few firms I\u2019ve seen in 30 years that have reinvented the model of venture capital.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The firm wouldn\u2019t exist were it not for a visit to the blackjack tables in Las Vegas. The story sounds like the setup to a cheesy joke: A finance executive and a biochemical engineer walk into a casino\u2009\u2026\u2009In this case the two men, who had grown close while working to market the multiple myeloma drug Velcade at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, were making their annual gambling pilgrimage in 2006. They commiserated over the drug industry and its loathed reputation for valuing profits over patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cThe patients are getting screwed,\u201d Kevin Starr said. \u201cWe need to do something.\u201d Now 52, Starr is a finance executive who rides a motorcycle and favors skull rings. Next to him sat Mark Levin, now 62, a biochemical engineer who worked at Eli Lilly and Genentech before joining Millennium. They soon expanded the discussion to include Robert Tepper, 59, a former oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who headed R&amp;D at Millennium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">After the three left the company, they explored new ideas. They toured academic research facilities and found what Starr calls \u201cjaw-dropping innovation.\u201d But the ideas rarely progressed beyond scholarly journals. \u201cWe said, \u2018Why is this sitting here in academia?\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Money was the reason. Biotech had a hot run in the 1990s. But by the early 2000s the costs of taking a drug to market had grown prohibitive, the odds slim. VCs mostly focused on later-stage companies or fled biotech altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996354\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=166\" alt=\"VEN-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Tepper, Starr, and Levin decided to create a firm that would conceive and build businesses from scratch. (The name was inspired by a news report that discussed the changes on Earth, the third rock from the sun\u2014not by the TV show of that name.) The trio started hiring Ph.D.s and MDs from Harvard and MIT. Many VCs scoffed, the Third Rock partners say. But by 10 weeks in, the firm had raised its first fund, $378 million. To stay focused on patients, the firm instituted a quarterly practice of inviting them to come talk about living with a rare disease or cancer. \u201cWe always cry our eyes out and get fired up to go back to the office,\u201d Starr says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Foundation Medicine was one of the first ideas to get traction. The concept was based on research by Eric Lander, a leader in the Human Genome Project and founder of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. They wondered, what if they could sell a diagnostic test that uses DNA sequencing to help determine which cancer drugs could best fight a particular patient\u2019s tumor?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock invited Lander to weekly <\/span><span class=\"s5\">brainstorming sessions along with Alexis<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> Borisy, then CEO of CombinatoRx, which uses software to match combinations of cancer drugs to treat certain tumor cells. They discussed how to scale up testing and make it affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cIt was going to be hard to do,\u201d says Borisy, who later joined Third Rock. A sequencing test then cost tens of thousands of dollars. They needed the price to sink to $2,000\u2014and they needed to persuade insurers to pay for it. For 18 months, teams from Third Rock and the Broad Institute met with experts in gene sequencing and with diagnostic companies. They talked to pharma companies, met with cancer doctors and insurers, and worked with regulators. They built models for DNA testing. \u201cIt was group genius,\u201d says Borisy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">When Foundation finally launched in 2010, Third Rock backed it with $25 million. Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins later kicked in too. The total, $40 million, far exceeded the typical $5 million to $8 million Series A biotech round. The goal: Allow the CEO to focus on growth rather than the next investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">By 2012, Borisy decided it was time for Foundation to leave the nest. He hired a CEO, and over the next two years the company rolled out two DNA-based cancer tests, collaborated with cancer centers and drug companies, and landed a $56 million investment from Bill Gates and others. In September 2013, Foundation went public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Third Rock won\u2019t disclose its returns. But according to the website of one of its investors, Calpers, its 2007 fund has generated an internal rate of return of 25.7%. That puts it well into the top performance quartile, according to alternative-investment tracker Preqin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Meanwhile the hot IPO market, along with FDA efforts to accelerate approvals for breakthrough drugs, has helped rekindle VC interest in early-stage biotech. For Starr, the goal is to reach more cancer patients. \u201cFor us, these aren\u2019t investments,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s validation that our babies are coming into adolescence.\u201d\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"19\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4066655983001-19\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066655983001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1CFLddY\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;impl=s&amp;output=xml_vast2&amp;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&amp;sz=1000x1&amp;cust_params=tags%3Dnewyorkfashionweek%2Cnike%2Cnikesacai%2Cniketeamingupwithsacai%2Cnikewomensapparel%2Cnikewomensclothing%2Cnyfw%2Csacai%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dnike&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;correlator=timestamp\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 09:30:06","updated":"2015-02-19 09:30:06","minute":"9:30 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/third-rock-ventures-giving-birth-to-a-new-generation-of-biotechs\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Third Rock Ventures: Giving birth to a new generation of biotechs","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ven01_1.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by Brad DeCecco for Fortune Magazine","caption":"From left: Mark Levin, Robert Tepper, and Kevin Starr of Third Rock Ventures","attach_id":"996311"},"excerpt":"<p>Third Rock is more than a venture capital firm.

Here\u2019s why.","content":"<p>As highlighted in Hay Group\u2019s recent book <em>Leadership 2030<\/em>, six powerful megatrends are transforming the global business environment as we know it: globalization 2.0, environmental crisis, technology convergence, individualism, digitization, and demographic change. These six megatrends are also fundamentally changing how people work and what they want from their employers.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the survey* we conducted in connection with the 2015 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies (WMAC) ranking, the megatrends and the challenges they present are very much on the minds of senior leaders in these organizations. Globalization, in particular, is at the forefront of business planning and strategies.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because a new economic order is emerging, which we call \u201cGlobalization 2.0.\u201d Power continues to shift to fast-developing markets in Asia \u2013 to India and China, in particular. In fact, the International Monetary Fund predicts that by 2050 only three of the top 10 world economies will be in the West \u2013 U.S., Germany and the U.K. To exploit opportunities, companies will need to increase local participation in strategic and operational decisions.<\/p>\n<p>The labor market will also go global, with increasing cross-border competition for talent. And big collaboration will be key. Companies will need to put in place the cultures, platforms, and processes to make collaboration easier and equip people with the right skills to foster effective cooperation. Only 55% of employees worldwide currently give their organizations high marks for effective collaboration across departments and functions, based on Hay Group\u2019s global employee opinion norms. Globalization 2.0 will take the collaboration challenge a step further, and based on this year\u2019s survey scores, the WMACs are already planning ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Globalization is seen to be a much more pressing issue by the WMACs than by peer organizations. Seventy-two percent of WMAC respondents report that globalization will have a \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d impact on their organizations, as compared with 52% of peer company respondents. A key challenge will be \u201cbalancing domestic vs. global business opportunities and allocating resources effectively amid quickly changing consumer consumption behaviors,\u201d according to one U.S. executive.<\/p>\n<p>Sixty-one percent of WMAC respondents see globalization as one of the top three megatrends impacting their strategic workforce planning (i.e., the future composition of the workforce), versus 46% of peer company respondents. Likewise, 58% of WMAC respondents see globalization as one of the top three megatrends influencing their employee engagement strategies, versus 44% of peer company respondents. One European executive, for instance, points to enhanced opportunities in a global labor market to access motivated employees: \u201cmore employment will move to international locations in emerging markets, and also target immigrants with higher aspirations and work ethics.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:350px;line-height:1em;text-align:left;border:8px;background-color:#d3d3d3;padding:7px;\"><strong>Who\u2019s getting Globalization 2.0 right?<\/strong>One of the nine attributes of reputation on which companies are evaluated as part of the WMAC rankings is <em>Effectiveness in Conducting Business Globally<\/em>. These are the leaders in 2015:<strong><br \/>\n1. Walt Disney<br \/>\n2. Nestl\u00e9<br \/>\n3. Apple<br \/>\n4. Caterpillar<br \/>\n5. Google<br \/>\n6. Nike<br \/>\n7. IBM<br \/>\n8. Toyota Motor<br \/>\n9. McDonald&#8217;s<br \/>\n10. Facebook<\/strong><\/div>\n<p>Fortunately, WMACs also feel considerably better prepared to respond to increasing globalization. Seventy-three percent of WMAC respondents report that a plan is either already being implemented or has been defined and agreed, as compared with just 46% of peer company respondents. Likewise, 86% of WMAC respondents indicate that leaders in their companies are currently effective in managing with a global perspective, versus 75% of peer company respondents. At the same time, WMACs don\u2019t underestimate the challenges. As one U.S. executive cautions: \u201cChange is happening at varying pace and with varying impact across the organization. Different leaders experience the impacts at different times. The biggest challenge is getting consensus and alignment around how things are changing and ultimately what the appropriate response is across all the various levels within the organization.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The human capital priorities most frequently cited by WMAC respondents as \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d suggest that, in their view, leadership and talent will be a key to success. Getting the right talent in different markets to support growth is at the top of the agenda for 95% of respondents. To respond, one U.S. executive indicates a focus on \u201cexpanding our global operations, increasing our diversity efforts to include global issues, and working on cultural issues to attract and retain new talent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Also high on the list of human capital priorities is recruiting and\/or developing leaders with the skills needed to be successful in the future (97% of respondents) and leadership succession planning (91% of respondents). Challenges WMACs are attempting to navigate include \u201cdealing with talent shortages for leadership roles,\u201d \u201cdeveloping next generation leadership benches,\u201d and \u201chelping Baby Boomer leaders adapt to rapid change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A weak labor market associated with the economic downturn may have held down turnover rates in many organizations. But it could be argued that we have been in the eye of a turnover storm. And the backside is coming \u2013 soon. After broadly flat levels in recent years, worldwide employee turnover is set to accelerate. Another recent Hay Group study predicts that by the end of 2018 almost a quarter of people worldwide will have changed jobs from the ones they currently have now. That\u2019s some 192 million workers who will hand in their notice over the next four years. So it\u2019s not surprising that retaining key talent is seen as a pressing human capital challenge by 93% of respondents.<\/p>\n<p>To succeed amid Globalization 2.0, it won\u2019t be enough to merely operate internationally. Instead, companies will need to be truly global in all that they do.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>They will need to align business units and subsidiaries around a common strategic vision and corporate culture<\/em>. Companies operating globally face significant challenges in coordinating far-flung operations. Procedural systems are essential. But global organizations are unlikely to be able to rely on them exclusively, given the complexity associated with diverse markets. Emphasizing consensus on a broader set of corporate objectives is a critical complement.<\/li>\n<li><em>They will need to drive execution through performance management and compensation systems that promote global consistency and emphasize enterprise-wide as well as local objectives<\/em>. Designing effective performance management systems in global companies can be particularly challenging, given the diverse and at times competing goals of managers across business units. The best approaches encourage managers to strike a balance between local objectives and larger enterprise-wide goals. Consistent approaches to performance management are critical for managing talent globally, to assess and place individuals in positions that work both for the company and their career growth.<\/li>\n<li><em>They will need to manage talent actively to meet organizational needs and develop breadth of leadership perspective<\/em>. Our research has repeatedly demonstrated that leaders in WMACs take a very \u201chands on\u201d approach to developing talent. They devote a significant portion of their time to talent management and providing ongoing coaching to their people. And, as a result, leaders in WMACs report that they have a better understanding of the capabilities of managers at all levels and do a better job of matching individuals to jobs, based both on the required skills associated with various roles and the career objectives and motivations of their people.

Just months earlier he had become CEO of the giant financial institution (No. 95 on the <i>Fortune<\/i> 500) that manages retirement investments for thousands of university professors and other employees of educational, medical, government, and cultural institutions. It came through the crisis fine and has since grown to almost $900 billion of assets under management. Ferguson, 63, was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1999 to 2006. He talked recently with <i>Fortune<\/i> about crisis leadership, retirement misconceptions, and much else. Edited excerpts: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em><span class=\"s2\">Where are you finding investment value now?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">We still think there are opportunities in alternative investments\u2014timber, agriculture, real estate, etc. In liquid investments, many people think small-cap companies are likely to have a bit of a run. A number of folks think Europe and perhaps even Asia, places that have been heavily beaten down, are subject to a rebound. But we try not to be market timers, so we follow a very disciplined, broadly diversified approach, and we recommend that to everybody<span class=\"s3\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em><span class=\"s2\">Activist investors have been in the news. Have the Icahns and Einhorns of the world been good for shareholders?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s too early to say. The reason is that in many cases they\u2019re interested in driving up equity valuations in a short period of time. There\u2019s another approach to active investing, which we follow, which is trying to work with management, develop a better strategy, and see that executed over time. That should produce much better returns, perhaps over a longer period and a little more sustainably. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em><span class=\"s4\">Some researchers say the retirement crisis is overhyped. What\u2019s the truth?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The truth is we have a retirement challenge that could become a crisis if we don\u2019t address it. Social Security is totally capable of paying all its obligations now\u2014but in the next 15 or 20 years, if we do nothing, Social Security will be able to pay only 75% of its obligations. It\u2019s not yet a crisis, but that puts a big premium on Social Security reform sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em><span class=\"s4\">What\u2019s the most <\/span><\/em><span class=\"s2\"><em>unrealistic expectation that people have about retirement<\/em>?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s that their retirement is going to be like their grandfather\u2019s retirement. People don\u2019t realize that life expectancies have gone up, that we are healthier and therefore could have more active and longer retirements than they might imagine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><em><span class=\"s2\">What\u2019s the most valuable thing you learned from leading TIAA-CREF through the financial crisis?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One is foresight. My team and I all had a sense that things were unraveling maybe more quickly than others had seen. The ability to look a little into the future is very important. The second thing is to communicate, communicate, and, did I <\/span>say, communicate. Make sure people understand how you are seeing the world and why you\u2019re making the decisions <span class=\"s1\">you\u2019re making. That allows them to align their decision-making to your decision-making<\/span><span class=\"s3\">.\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of

class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pity the pig farmer. Over the past seven months, since oil began its precipitous decline, lean hogs were the one major benchmark commodity to fall even further, according to the CME Group. The price of lean hogs\u2014a term referring to butchered pigs regardless of paunch\u2014has sunk 51.3% since the end of June. The drop follows record-high prices this past summer, after a disease called the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus whacked supplies. \u201cThe baby pigs were being wiped out at a rate that was never thought possible,\u201d says Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. But the virus subsided surprisingly quickly, and more little piggies started making it to market. The USDA recently revised its projections to show 5.5% growth in pork production this year. Meanwhile, less American pork is being shipped overseas because of slowing international demand, driving a glut. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm for pigs,\u201d says Steve Wagner, a market analyst for CHS Hedging. Wagner expects that lean-hog prices will linger at decade lows for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/bri-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996422\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/bri-03-01-15.jpg?quality=80&#038;w=545&#038;h=285\" alt=\"BRI-03-01-15\" width=\"545\" height=\"285\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>This story is from the March 1, 2015 issue of Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"February 19, 2015","published":"2015-02-19 06:30:30","updated":"2015-02-19 06:30:30","minute":"6:30 AM EST","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/this-is-the-only-commodity-to-fall-more-than-oil\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/this-is-the-only-commodity-to-fall-more-than-oil\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/02\/19\/this-is-the-only-commodity-to-fall-more-than-oil\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"This is the only commodity to fall more than oil","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/bri03_2.jpg?quality=80&w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Monier\u2014 AFP Photo","caption":"","attach_id":"996448"},"excerpt":"<p>The price of lean hogs\u2014a term referring to butchered pigs regardless of paunch\u2014has sunk 51.3% since the end of June.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"462439","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/jen-wieczner\/","name":"Jen Wieczner","twitter":"jenwieczner","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/jen-wieczner-7341.jpg?quality=80&amp;w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"FORTUNE MAGAZINE DITORS HEADSHOTS -

No. 80<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>U.S. Headquarters: New York City<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Perk: A shared leave program allows employees to donate unused paid time-off to co-workers who might need it in an emergency. Last year workers gave 10,000 hours.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the stereotype goes, accountants are a species of professional often seen as spiritless human calculators\u2014and not as indispensable visionaries. \u201c\u2018Taxes must be boring.\u2019 I get that all the time,\u201d says Kirt Bocox, senior tax manager at KPMG, one of the firm\u2019s many employees who dispute\u2014indeed refute\u2014that pre-conception. \u201cPeople get the stereotype of accountants completely wrong. It\u2019s actually exciting and fun.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bocox is not the only impassioned one. To hear Bruce Pfau, vice chairman of human resources and communications, tell it, the company, based in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, gushes with enthusiasm. So he devised a plan to harness that energy: Instead of dictating what employees <i>should<\/i> consider their motivating force, the company asked each to think up his or her own and frame it on a poster. HR provided a template on the organization\u2019s internal website, KPMG Today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that culture is the most important dimension of any CEO\u2019s responsibility to an organization,\u201d says John Veihmeyer, global chairman and CEO of KPMG in the U.S., who kicked off the program in June with a video in which he stood on the Top of the Rock in New York City to announce a goal: the \u201c10,000 stories challenge.\u201d If the company received that many posters by Thanksgiving, everyone would earn two extra days of paid vacation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Posters rolled in by the thousands in the first week\u2014\u201cI advance science,\u201d \u201cI promote peace,\u201d \u201cWe protect our nation.\u201d And they rolled in by the thousands during the second too. Even Phil Mickelson, the KPMG-sponsored pro golfer, joined in with one of his own: \u201cI win titles.\u201d By July the company had blown well past the 10,000 mark\u2014and submissions kept coming. By the time it ended in November, the company had received more than four times the requested number of posters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThe initiative enormously exceeded our expectations, and morale scores soared to historic highs,\u201d says Pfau. In fact, in a recent engagement survey, the percentage of its U.S. employees who endorsed KPMG as a great place to work jumped to 85%.
