<p><span>It has occurred to me that there are things which you should fear because they might actually cause you harm (either physically OR emotionally).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are also things which other people tell you that you should be really, really afraid of and, well, you&#8217;ll see.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span><b>Things (my personal favorites) which inspire TERROR:</b></span></i><br />
<span><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>Any envelope with the words &#8216;Internal Revenue Service&#8217; written on it.</i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>A phone call received on the home phone after Midnight.</i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>Reaching over and opening the cabinet under the bathroom sink to grab that extra roll of Charmin and finding&#8230;&nbsp; Nothing but air (BONUS:&nbsp; The tissue box on the sink is empty). </i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>Waking up in the morning, looking at the outdoor thermometer finding that it&#8217;s -12 degrees outside and wondering, &#8220;Did I let the dog in last night?&#8221;&nbsp; (Of course I did, she&#8217;s laying on the bed between me and my wife&#8230;&nbsp; And the dog is snoring happily)</i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>Opening the online banking account and realizing that I didn&#8217;t CANCEL the automated bill pay for the $0 balance Discover Card this week, leaving us $500 short for the next two weeks &#8211; now I have to charge stuff to get my money back.</i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i>Pulling my underwear / sock drawer open on a Wednesday morning and finding lots of socks&#8230;&nbsp; Luckily, the hamper is FULL of previously worn, slightly-damp clothing.</i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><i><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></i></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>There are more, I guess, but the thing is that we ALL have things that freak us out when we see, hear, or otherwise experience them firsthand.</span></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><span><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>Yeah, like this. &nbsp; </span></span></span><br />

<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>Oddly enough, however, the things that we are TOLD to be afraid of to which we&#8217;ve become pretty much immune because the things which we are told are going to &#8216;most certainly happen&#8217;&#8230;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t seem to come to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />

<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>This last article is my favorite, because the thought of &#8216;Two Orange Dwarf Stars&#8217; reaching our solar system DOES sound exponentially &#8216;scary&#8217;.&nbsp; </span></span></span><br />

<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>But when you open the article read the first two paragraphs which follow the ominous headline above, you find the following:</span></span></span><br />

<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
<span><span style="font-size: small"><span><i><span>&nbsp; Some would say that the given time frame is truly a long stretch from today. However, the big threat that the phenomena might cause makes the study worth considering as it will have direct effect to future humanity.</span></i></span></span></span><br />
<span><span style="font-size: small"><span><i><span><span><span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: white"><span>.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span>European astrophysicist Coryn Bailer-Jones who works at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany is <b>predicting that around 14 stars might come within the next few million years</b>. The astrophysicist came to this prediction after analysing the computer-simulated orbits of more than 50,000 stars that are nearby. The prediction also says that among the thousands of neighboring stars, there at least two that humanity should worry about, Forbes reports.&nbsp; </span></i></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<span><span style="font-size: small"><span>There are people who build careers by spreading fear, panic, discontent, and yes, even anger (think &#8216;Al Sharpton&#8217;).&nbsp; They work in the private sector, for the government, they work for major newspapers, they work for organizations which skim for scary scientific headlines to expand upon their &#8216;online readership&#8217; and sell &#8216;space&#8217; to advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When asked why this unique intergalactic strategy was necessary at this point in human history, Presidential Spokesperson, Alfred Dimwitty said the following in today&#8217;s press conference, &#8220;The President has solved ALL major issues which he cares deeply about on Earth and felt it was time to set his sights higher than his predecessors.  Barack Obama cares so much about US that he has proactively sent messages out to Cylon Ambassadors and he has outlined very specific conditions for Earth&#8217;s unilateral surrender to the world-plundering, life-snuffing Cylon race of cybernetic organisms.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asked by one reporter if the spokesperson knew that Cylons were &#8216;make-believe&#8217; villains of the science fiction series, &#8220;Battlestar Galactica&#8221;, he responded, &#8220;Just because they were the &#8216;bad guys&#8217; of a television series in the late 1970&#8242;s AND the mid-2000&#8242;s this does not make them any less real than you and I.  After all, how do we know that the series was a FICTIONAL scenario?  Those characters must have been based on something, and the President has chosen boldly to make peace with them BEFORE they attack our planet &#8211; we call it, &#8220;The Obama Interstellar Doctrine&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A man in overalls sitting in the front row of the briefing room raises his hand and asks &#8220;Yes, but, um, even if they are REAL &#8211; he&#8217;s making peace by surrendering the Earth to them?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Have you seen those monsters?  They&#8217;re shiny, buff-polished metal beasties and they carry laser-blaster weapons things &#8211; how can you expect us to possibly fight them since the President spent the past six years quietly downsizing our Military and destroying NASA!?!?&#8221; Dimwitty begins to look a tense as small flecks of spittle fly from his quickly moving lips.  &#8220;For the love of God man, they have these Death Ship things which can blow the Earth clean out its orbit!!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;THEY ARE A MENACE TO OUR EARTH AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECAME A CRISIS!&#8221; Dimwitty shouts as his hands clench spasmodically on the podium in front of him.  &#8220;THE PRESIDENT DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO SAVE US ALL!!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: white">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Huh, well, alrighty then&#8230;  Might you be forgetting something Alfred?  Something, excuse me, more specifically someone, equally important when it comes to threat-levels?&#8221; the man asks as he grins widely at Dimwitty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: white">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;AND WHAT, EXACTLY WOULD THAT BE!?!?&#8221; Dimwitty is screaming as he pushes his damp hair back from his forehead with one fidgeting hand.  &#8220;AND WHY ARE YOU SMILING AT ME!?!?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: white">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to upset you any more than you already are, but, how does the President plan on handling the Borg threat?&#8221; he asks this as he sits back down in the front row, crosses his arms and waits for what must certainly come next&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Secret Service Agent standing at the left side of the stage walks to the podium where the spokesperson is now shaking violently and is supported solely by the wooden structure in front of him.  The agent pulls an iPhone out of his pocket and points to the device, instructing Dimwitty to look at the message which has just arrived.  Dimwitty straightens and says, &#8220;It&#8217;s the President, and he has another announcement he wants me to make in exactly one hour &#8211; it&#8217;s IMPORTANT.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The man in the overalls pushes himself up from the chair, stretches, turns from the podium and walks toward the nearest exit door.  Seeing this, Dimwitty speaks loudly over the murmur which has erupted from the press reporters, &#8220;So where are YOU going &#8211; don&#8217;t you want to be here for the next announcement?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Nope.  Buddy, over the past six years I&#8217;ve seen and heard this all before.  Your boss makes up crises which do not exist, he ignores crises which do exist, he takes credit for whatever does (or does not) happen and then he moves on to the next &#8216;crisis du jour&#8217; as he gazes thoughtfully into the camera / teleprompter reading some script that a lackie from Hollywood has written for him.  You guys have got this thing down to a science.  &#8220;Never let a crisis go to waste&#8221; isn&#8217;t that what Rham Emanuel said?  And in January, 2015, you&#8217;re gonna have your hands full of crises with the Republicans running the House and Senate &#8211; your boss is actually going have to show who&#8217;s side he&#8217;s on now that Harry Reid&#8217;s no longer able to bury the 300+ House Bills in his desk drawers.  I have a feeling that a whole lot of stuff is going to pulled out of drawers over the next two years &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty much okay with that,&#8221; the man says as he tugs on the straps of his overalls, turns and begins to exit the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;But, buth, what about the Borg?&#8221; Dimwitty asks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="color: white">.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Resistance is futile Alfred, don&#8217;t you know that?  Buddy, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the Borg, what you&#8217;ve got to worry about is the rest of the &#8216;Collective&#8217;, you know, the people you guys haven&#8217;t listened to for almost six full years.  The worker bees are angry, the cops are angry, the people you&#8217;ve persecuted with the IRS, the veterans you&#8217;ve lied to with the VA, and guys like me who want nothing more to be left alone so we can raise our families with OUR values, not those of the folks at PETA, PLANNED PARENTHOOD, CAIR, AL SHARPTON&#8217;s ACTION NETWORK, UNIONS, and any other &#8216;Rules for Radicals&#8217; drones you plan on tossing in front of us.  We&#8217;re done with you, we&#8217;re taking our country back from you and your fleshy-headed mutant friends,&#8221; the man&#8217;s words echo across the room then the door slams shut behind him.</span></p>

“We have enough equipment to meet our current needs. Where we would like to see more equipment is actually as we grow our own food program.

One of the challenges related to feeding students is rodents.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
The forces which produced this entity, the one before you now, were born in the pits of sadistic narcissism.  What self-absorbed god could have preconceived to me such a horrific destiny without a semblance of mercy as to cut it short in its infancy?  It was left to me to live it; always an eye on self termination, the other on the seditious timeline which I was sure would fold back upon itself like a celebrity bus tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stench of moth balls are my only nostalgia, for I was born in a closet to a woman too timid to inform her husband he had another mouth to feed.  My first memories were of blindness and immobility.  I used to entertain myself for days on end by imagining seeing myself move.  My freedom came when there were finally too many children in the closet which prevented my mother from getting the door closed during a nighttime feeding.  On discovering he had twelve children, my father was actually quite proud. The anguish of our handicaps and unnecessary imprisonment was somewhat offset by being dragged around the neighborhood to be shown off as a testament to Dad’s virility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father, to his credit, was a drifter and we rarely saw him.  He would float from real estate attorney to street pimp; he was a sports agent and a jazz musician, an environmental consultant and a ballet coach stopping at home only long enough to make another sibling.  He did however, see to it that we had a comfortable trailer in a celebrity park (not one, but two of our neighbors had won Maytags on the “Queen for a Day” television show) and gave my mother a substantial discount on the rent: the only stipulation being that we were to do our own maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although twelve children being raised in a thirty-two foot trailer may sound impoverished, we were far from ‘white trash.’ In fact, we were the only Black Jews we knew of until Sammy Davis Jr. converted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a black man, it was inevitable that I would excel at the two sports dominated by my race today – basketball and self-pity.  My skills at the latter were undertaken with vigor after 1965 when we were informed how poor and helpless we were by a charmingly crude Texan who declared ‘war on poverty.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Affirmative Action didn&#8217;t contribute any to our previous spiritual perseverance but we certainly got more stuff.  The more we got through this eternal Executive Order, the more we were resented, thus justifying our internal pity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even if whitey had behaved himself without the threat of a lawsuit, we, ourselves could keep the old bigotry pot boiling, for among us raged the light skin – dark skin controversy; a divisive but well kept secret until Michael Jackson went berserk.  This esoteric envy is the black mother’s engine that drives her to implore her children to “marry light,” not to be confused with the great tasting, less filling nuptial.  This secret hypocrisy could in time, backfire on us.  How seriously could our oppressors take us if we were to show up at a boycott wearing our polyester batakaris, chanting pidgin Bemba and looking like indignant Phil Donahues? The constant mantra of “poor and oppressed” used to describe us by guilty fish bellies is inconsistent with the Lincolns and the 3/2 brick ranchettes which quite a few of us now occupy.  But no matter.  There are still enough inept among us to concentrate upon and as we all know, it is a hate crime to criticize us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Diaspora Jew, a perpetual paranoia of pending persecution was impossible to escape as well as a preponderance of ‘P’ words needed to describe it.  This paranoia tends to force us to strive for positions of power so that the infrastructure can never gain a grip on us and if attempted, there are scores of unreleased Woody Allen movies waiting on the shelf to be dumped on unruly Gentiles when the situation deems proper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us are non-religious so it is not the faith so much that unites us but rather our ties to the homeland—-New York City and the occupied territories of Miami, Hollywood and Wall Street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us yearns for a pilgrimage to the land of our birth and most of us accept the fact that we will never go.  It is difficult to find a trustworthy Gentile to run the deli in our absence.  This distrust does breed resentment against us but pickle loaf costs more than two dollars a pound wholesale and no self respecting Jew would let that go to rot just for a chance to visit the site on which his foreskin is buried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we do not accept the Christian Messiah rather than condemn His existence, our oppression is more subtle.  Since we control the court system it’s of no concern, but does justify our paranoia to outsiders.  Nonetheless, paranoia can prevent complacency and it is in our best interests to continue to scare ourselves to death, for some day should we let our guard down, the Gentiles will surely figure out the loopholes in the child labor laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not my intention to incarnate into the two most oppressed groups in world history.  In fact, it must have been my prenatal destiny to absorb every miserable lot.  The truth is, I am also gay and enjoy clogging.  Needless to say my passion for the art goes unfulfilled.  Not many black jews can be seen at an East Kentucky barn dance.  But I can live with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My gayness is of course, a secret.  My lover knows and his lover knows and his lover’s lover knows and so on down the line, but no one else knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I live a tough life.  But for every challenge, there is a benefit.  For instance, as a black man, I could not order a pizza delivered to my neighborhood—-especially after dark.  But as a jew, I could bring it home with me because I own a chain of Papa Piazzio’s Pizza Palaces.  We deliver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being black, I am a gifted athlete.  But as a jew, I prefer air conditioning.  Therefore, if I was so inclined, I could excel at bowling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Jew, I cannot join the swanky yacht club.  As a black man, I could come and go as I please simply by carrying around a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Jew, I can easily pass the Bar Exam.  But, as a black, I would most likely be incarcerated before I was allowed to complete it.  However, jailhouse quasi-lawyers are always in demand since legitimate lawyers never seem to reside in these institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are at times, personal conflicts within.  My Jewish side can be quite pompous toward my black side.  I retaliate by committing a petty crime or two to embarrass my Jewish side, but the little hebe has connections and my black indiscretions are covered up before they enter the court system or even become public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At other times my Black side thinks my Jewish side is too conservative.  The street thug in me wants a fur dashboard or maybe a truck chain necklace with a padlock on it.  My Jewish side wants a certificate of deposit.  My Gay side insists on a pedicure.  On these issues I can usually compromise and in this case I did.  I bought a new suit; it was a gaudy color but it had thin lapels and came with open toed loafers.</p>
<p>In general, I am miserable with my status in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up teeter-tottering between these three worlds, but eventually succumbed to a convenient combination of all—secretiveness, self pity and paranoia.  It should come as no surprise then, that I would eventually end up in a movement which celebrates all of those traits.  I became a Christian—not just a run-of-the-mill Christian, but a white, identified one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those unschooled in the ways of hate—the sum of pity, paranoia and seclusion, Christian Identity is an important part of the white supremacy movement.  It is not to be confused with the Klan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Klan actually fizzled out in the mid 20th Century until it was revived in the ‘70s by southern fund-raising genius who turned bigotry into a big business.  To him, “find a need and fill it” was no idle slogan. He started a very profitable non-profit called, &#8220;The Center for Impoverished Lawyers Living Below the Mason-Dixon Line&#8221; (CILLBMDL) to provide us Black folks a tangible reason for our failures, us Jews a reason to stay on top and of course, us poofs a reason to stay in the closet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But one can hardly sustain an office staff to simply follow David Duke around.  And that occurred to CILLBMDL.  A telephone call to the FBI swelled the ranks of the dwindling cross burners to immense proportions.  There was a lot to watch and much to fear.  But eventually it was discovered that 97 percent of Klan membership was made up of FBI informants.  It was also discovered that all of the 78 actual Klan members were Democrats. But you didn’t get that from me, understand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FBI immediately recalled its informants to be scattered among the more severe threats to the nation such as church members, military veterans, Bill Clinton’s bimbos and Americans with taxable income.  The Klan, as well as its watchers, dwindled once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CILLBMDL however, rebounded.  Out of that cocoon came the LawCenter for Poor Southern Hicks (LCPSH).  Despite its name, this institution is not a haven for destitute lawyers living below the Mason-Dixon Line.  It is a factory that produces tangible “thems.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blacks, Jews and Gays know we’re hated but it is not possible to finger the culprit.  Until LCPSH, it was “they” that hated us.  But one knows what “they” say, doesn’t one?  “They” blame it on “them.”  As victims, it is hard to debate our cause by claiming persecution from bigoted pronouns.  “They” don’t take one seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What LCPSH did was to put a face on “them.”  And “them” faces be white and “them” faces claimeth to be Christian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was during my study of LCPSH and their work on our behalf that I discovered Christian identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I was afraid of them.  LCPSH had done such a wonderful job of lumping all white, Christian conservatives in with the extreme “patriots” that I was certainly justified to think that “they” were all out to get me. Being a life-long Democrat, I was a sure that I was a victim of at least something.  While studying the tangible face LCPSH had put on my oppressors, I came to the realization that these particular Christians were as clandestine, pitiful and paranoid as I was.  In fact, we had so much in common subconsciously, that I felt, for the first time in my life that I fit in.</p>
<p>So I joined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although much more docile than in its glory days of the 1980s where guns, bombs and various poisons were manufactured in preparation for war with the Zionist Occupied Government, my new home on the shore of Bull Shoals Reservoir still functioned as a training center for various ‘whiter is better’ organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity beliefs are somewhat convoluted which would allow me some leeway for membership.  CI believes that Aryans are the decedents of the Biblical tribes of Israel.  Contemporary Jews are simply frauds in the employ of Satan.  Frankly, as a contemporary Jew, I wouldn&#8217;t know enough about Jewish history to dispute that claim.  But I was absolutely sure that a paycheck from Satan would have been much more generous than the ones I received from Uncle Sol when I worked in his shoe store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, my reception was marred by the fact that I had on my yarmulke and was listening to “The Woman in Me” by Donna Summers on my three-hundred watt, multi-channel Aiwa Moped Stereo System as I pulled up to the guardhouse.  The guard mouthed something which was drowned out by Donna’s orgasm. As a courtesy I turned her off, an unusual occurrence since most women are quite turned on by a man they can’t have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guard studied me with a reserved curiosity.  His dirty ball cap identified him as ‘instant idiot—just add alcohol.’  One side of his cheek bulged giving indication that I had just disturbed a winter nut foraging excursion.  A brown dribble exited the corner of his mouth and filtered through fuzzy stubble evidently to keep it from contaminating the old .22 Iver-Johnson strapped to his chest should gravity gain the upper hand over the vacuum behind his eyes.  The pistol I assumed, was just for show since he had it holstered upside down, barrel to chin.   Either that or he was first or second generation Irish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was quite a sight.  I thought of our loving God Who was kind enough to place our eyeballs behind the plane of our faces lest kadiddlehoppers such as our guard continuously scare themselves between blinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I chatted with the young man, The Bell Curve rang.  This man was the showcase.  A stereotype, much like my story thus far.  If this was representative of the superior race then it is certain that God had rested far more than the one day He claims. Most likely He had fallen asleep while all the sense was boiling out of the white people pot.  But I am not a bigot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, the Mark of Cain gave me away as a somewhat unusual visitor but it was my yarmulke which seemed to concern him the most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You a Jew, too?” he said as he had evidently learned the meaning of the little beanie in a training film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pointed out to him that if he said that real fast he would be ordering a gin and tonic in Swahili.  But he wasn&#8217;t amused.  Instead he picked up the phone on the guard house wall and dialed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within seconds there was a crowd of a hundred disturbed patriots setting up defenses against the singular horde of infidel poised to charge his moped up the ramp to Massada, Arkansas.  Perhaps they would chicken out like my dedicated ancestors or more recently, like the less admired copycats at Jonestown.</p>
<p>Alas.  Such was not to be.  Instead, a round fellow named Reverend waddled out to warmly greet me.</p>
<p>“Don’t get many niggers out here, boy,” he said with a glance back to his flock.  “How can we hep ye?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve come to join.  We have a lot in common.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laughter danced cautiously over the crowd waiting to be released or subdued according to Reverend’s signal.  But none came.  He froze with his eyes locked on me and his head cocked toward the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Come agin, boy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have a lot in common, sir,” I respectfully submitted.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That so?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” I replied.  It was obvious that Reverend was intrigued by the absurd possibility that I could come up with a persuasive case for brotherhood, although I was careful not to use that specific term.  Both ‘brother’ and ‘hood’ had negative connotations in whitey world.  But I was determined to make that case.  These people were my people and I desperately wanted to fit in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing the crowd, I made my pitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Friends, I ask you, are you misunderstood?  Is it not true that when you go to town to fetch supplies the townspeople cross the street to avoid you?  Do they not think you are dangerous threats to their personal security?  Do they allow their children to play with yours?  Do they understand your culture, the historical and psychological origins of your beliefs?  Will they refuse to drive through your neighborhood even though it’s a short cut to the barber shop or do they only visit with a quick and courageous obsession to obtain contraband?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you can answer truthfully, does it not mandate an invitation to the pity party?  Doesn’t it invoke delusions of inferiority, however invalid they may be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can answer that.  It does!  I know.  As a Black man I have experienced the blade of rejection as have you!  I have been labeled slow-witted, criminal, incorrigible.  Haven’t you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes.  Yes, of course you have!  And by whom?  Not by the forces of government.  Not by the tide of societal scrutiny.  Nor by the hand of a sanctimonious god! Who is it that scorns you? Who is it that scorns me? I’ll tell you! It is THEM! Both you and I are shunned by the powers that be.  I feel sorry for myself.  Don’t you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assessed my progress by interpreting facial expressions.  This was a difficult task because all white Gentles look alike to me and I was studying the faces of homonyms.  With the exact same expressions, half displayed a grasp of the principles while the others conveyed a deep disorientation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am afraid!  As a Jew, everywhere I go follows the sting of suspicion.  Is this not true with you also?</p>
<p>“The citizens among whom I must live believe I live for power; for domination over them and their kin.  With such mistrust flung against me, is it not reasonable to assume a cloak of paranoia?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Simply because I cling to my traditions and resist assimilation I am branded a subtle enemy, a cunning ring knocker sworn to take questionable deductions, accept discounts without purchasing in quantity and slant the news in my favor in collusion of the rest of my Diaspora brethren.  With this almost comical illusion, very real and very sinister efforts are made to exclude me from not only the positions of power, but of the normal ebb and flow of everyday investing. Can you, too, not relate to my lot?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I paused to gauge my efforts, but still the faces of stone seemed divided.  I pressed on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Do you know what it’s like to keep a lifestyle secret?  I’m sure you do.  But make no mistake, I do also.  Can you reload your ammunition in a public restroom without fear of arrest?  Can you articulate your political views on a civil service exam without consequence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As a gay man, I cannot produce a flower arrangement without the blinds drawn tight.  I cannot skip through the park on a summer’s day hand in hand with my beloved.  To do so is to invite the sneers and jeers of the ignorant masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Think about it!  Do you think you would be allowed to conduct firing practice at the parking lot of the church of your choice without attracting a disapproving crowd?  Can you burn your crosses in Times Square with impunity?  I think not!  And if not, can you not relate to my own anguish when I am forbidden to rub my lover’s but at a baseball game?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, we all must conduct our lives in secrecy lest we bring down the wrath of a disapproving society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am lonely!  I am isolated!  Can’t you see I am just like you!  Take away this outer shell and our differences vanish like cake at a weight loss clinic!  I tell you; this is where I belong, safe from the bigotry of Them!  Embrace me!  Protect me! Love me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All was silent, expressionless.  My Gospel was being digested.  If only I could receive an answer before it was excreted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My anticipation ended quickly as Reverend said, “Beat it, Jew-nigger.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is impossible to convey the crushing despair with which those words crippled my heart.  If I could not live here I would be destined to wander about the round world as a square peg.  It would be unbearable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mind raced to the psychic supply house to see if there could be another key to this gate.  And there it was!  Empathy!  I would put myself in their Brogans.  I would imagine my intellect at half capacity and then subtract twenty-two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wait!” I shouted as the crowd began to disperse, “There is something I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What don’tcha understand about ‘beat it, nigger?” asked Reverend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Not that, sir.  I don’t understand how this community works.  I mean, you’re self contained and self supporting.  That would mean that some of the residents would have to do the menial labor.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So, Reverend,” I said with as much humility as possible, “a self supporting community made up entirely of members of the superior race would mean, by any conceivable logic, that some racially superior members would be consigned to perform tasks beneath the dignity of their God Given status.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was obvious to me that I had used too much intellect to impart that concept, so I simplified, and I might add, quite crudely at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, sir.  It means that at least some of your people are doing nigger work.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>”Well, I’ll be&#8230;” Reverend broke off just in time.  Christian Identity adherents may be violently vulgar bigots but they do not swear.  It is an admirable quality the rest of us may wish to adopt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I could help you with that, Reverend.  After all, I’m a Black man and am used to the indignities of humble exertion.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did it again.  I regrouped and recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I could do all of the menial work, Reverend.  Of course, I would have to have an inferiority exemption to join but I just so happen to have a background in law so the paperwork would be no problem and my fees would be reasonable.  I might also add that my fees would be deductible and whereas said fees for the tax work would be considered business related, those too could be deducted provided I do the accounting to insure the compound is held harmless for any failure to file, as happens here quite often you know, contingent on the stipulation that we form a privileged attorney-client relationship for which I could legally incorporate into the accountant-client relationship to circumvent any attempts by the IRS to conduct an audit by invoking the Fourth Amendment against both privileged relationships.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Which means what?” said the perplexed Reverend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m not really sure myself but we could look it up in the Statutes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t pay heed to no ZOG statutes,” he replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, yes.  That’s true,” I acknowledged.  “But every three or four years Treasury and FBI agents come in and shoot the place up.  I could stop that or at least stretch it out to every eight or ten years.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You could?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Of course.  I’m a Jew.  I have connections.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Reverend pondered the advantages of diversity the crowd perked up.  I could see the distortion on their faces and theorized the cranial machinery was at work.  Evidently, I was the first to float the idea of diversified talents in a grunt they could understand.  It was a partial triumph.  But I did have them teetering. So I pressed my case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Look at this place!” I shouted.  “Look at this drab, flat, dreary homeland you&#8217;ve built.  I can’t live here!  It looks like a Communist shopping mall!  No color, no charm!  Why must we be so ascetic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Is it any wonder that our little community here stays little?  If we truly are God’s chosen, and if heaven truly is paved with gold through pearly gates, is it logical He’d let us in when we display such atrocious taste in décor?  What God, Who promises us a place at His elaborate table and one of His magnificent mansions would welcome into His meticulously prepared home such a tasteless lot who’s most acclaimed achievement is a geometrically flawed kibbutz peppered with pea green army barracks?  How are we to attract new members if the picture on our brochures resembles the cafeteria at a recycling plant?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, I am a Gay man.  But you must know how creative we are.  A few flower arrangements for starters.  Perhaps some lace.  I would do the barracks interiors in a soothing burgundy, champagne trim.  The community kitchen would have to be done in joyous yellows; the counter tops in green granite, the cabinets in light gray oak.  Some cherub paintings must hang in the meeting hall.  The flags must go.  There is so much testosterone dripping from them that they will have to be sent out to the barber’s every five weeks.  We can’t have that!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now jest a guhl dern minute,” Reverend interrupted.  “I ain’t havin’ no…..”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Uh, Reverend?” came a voice from the congregation. A young man slouched forward as if preparing to settle into a chin rest for an eye exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This hyere nigger fella’s makin’ sense. Me n’ Cassie hyere’s white folks. We shouldn’t be cleanin’ are own toulit’s.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Reverend could respond another voice pitched out of the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know about the rest of you but I’m getting’ pretty darn tired of parades.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman emerged from the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Maybe we should let this gay fella dance at one of ‘em? Maybe he could make one o’ them floats y’all see at the Mardi Gras?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My response was immediate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can do that!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You ain’t doin’ no sucha…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now hold on, Reverend,” said eye exam. “Yew know Ah ain’t no faggit fan but Edna maht be own t’ sumpthin’. Ah don’t see no hahm in lettin’ this swish prance around fer ennertainmint purpizes so long as he don’t wear one o’ them shiny shirts in front o’ the youngns’ n’ whatnot.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a confusing stir among the acerbate onlookers. I could not tell as to whether or not it was in my favor, but I seized the moment. Just before the Reverend was about to answer I brought myself to attention and dragged, brilliantly I might add, The Star-Spangled Banner through my gifted Black larynx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, my dear reader, there are indeed racial and cultural differences. When compared to the um-pah um-pah of a Bavarian tuba at a drunken Oktoberfest, a Black man ordering a wiener schnitzel in a loud voice is Divine music. One can well imagine that the Gates of Paradise are serenaded by overweight Black women while Lawrence Welk’s bubbles are sure to burst in a more sweltering atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music is the universal language… well, perhaps it’s mathematics which the Jew in me could handle, of course. But for this crowd a recitation of a workman’s comp audit would hardly have been appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Anthem, sung with soul, baby—that’s what brought us together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, after a few minutes of respectful silence one of the yah-hoos realized that I had just sang the most beautiful rendition of the anthem of the nation they loved run by the Zionists they hate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Reverend,” came a voice from the rear. “I think we ought to give this boy a chance. If he fouls up, we can always kill ‘im.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ah don’t thank so, Hank,” said the guard with the instant hat. “Thad’d be a hate crahm er some such.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Not so,” I interjected.” Under the law you would have to hurl an epithet at me or perhaps make a negative comment concerning my attire.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t give one iota what the ZOG law says,” said the Reverend. “You got me t’ thenking, Jew boy. White folks shouldn’t be doin’ no nigger work. But if we let you in, we’d have a nigger in our community. Once you let one in then the whole community gits took over. Nah, I ain’t havin’ it”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I still say we give ‘m a shot,” said Hank. If he don’t work out we can give ‘m a shot.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laughter tricked out of the crowd here and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edna piped up, “He’s right y’ know, the colored boy. He knows how we feel bein’ cooped up in this compound because the rest of society don’t understand us. Wouldn’t any one of us like to reload our ammo in a public park without havin’ the law come out n’ harass us? He may be a nigger, faggot Jew but at least he understands us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debate was on. Eventually practicality won out over hatred and a compromise was reached. There were restrictions of course. I could not wear anything Jewish or gay. Since I could not change my skin color, I was only let out at night lest the Idaho competitors score a huge coup with their recruiting brochures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But these were minor to me. Here I had finally found a home. While we appeared to be as different as night and day, in truth, we understood each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Edna missed her family, I could relate. When some of the compound children were harassed in town for wearing their swastika t-shirts it was I who consoled them with my story of being laughed at by a perspective employer when I showed up for the interview with my britches down below my butt and a pocket protector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also empathized with Hargus, our most militant member when he refused to allow me to paint his olive drab quarters. I explained to him that Black people often paint their houses pink and purple and that it is not unusual to find a white couch in a gay apartment. His preference should not be ridiculed even by members of our own community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began to make many friends among the CI community particularly those that felt disenfranchised. I could relate to their ostracism. I was surprised really, at the number. It seemed to me that this tight knit community was, in secret, very diverse indeed. But life went on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ensuing months the camp came to life. The barracks burst with elaborate color save Hargus’ of course. New flags were designed with just a hint of feminine aroma. The roster was simplified and the weapons inventoried. The recruiting was streamlined until our ranks swelled to capacity. Sports and various entertainment options were available to all. We became the number one tourist destination in Arkansas for hate fans throughout the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I became involved with the printing press operator. He was not very bright or attractive but I’m gay and I live in a Nazi compound. It’s not like I have a lot of options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slowly, things began to change. The comrades were friendlier, more outgoing. I was allowed outdoors during daylight hours. People here began to discuss their personal problems with each other. My relationship was discovered because my stupid lover couldn&#8217;t keep his yap shut. But, no matter. We were accepted as a couple. Now I was free to dump him and find a more attractive mate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose the height of my life was the visit to our compound by the head of LCPSH. Incredible as it may seem, he was very impressed with our operation. As any General will tell you it is more flattering to be commended by your enemy than your peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had arrived! The miserable, putrid life I was destined to live had become a hazy, bad memory. These were my people. This is my home!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, one crisp autumn day, they dragged me out to the shooting range and blew my head off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, being dead allows one to review life in a more unbiased, comprehensive manner; and it takes just seconds to complete. Since I never saw it coming I was not inclined to ponder the absurdity of it. Perhaps I could have thought, “Why are you going to kill me? What have I done?” But had I the precognition and the allotted time to render such a question, of what value would the answer contain? Am I not just as dead for any reason?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you still living a life whether pleasant or pained you may believe those questions to be relevant. I tell you they are not. My comrades were kind not to inform me of my impending doom, although one living may see cowardice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, there are no words; just knowing. And that is the key. There is no brain, just Mind. And it is only here that one realizes it is the brain that is the problem. It does not come with an instruction manual and God, for whatever reason allows any idiot to have one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the brain’s material language it is the carnal that dominates. It is true even with the most basic of human emotions&#8211;love and hate. Love hate. Hate love. I love hate. I hate love. When these two words, regardless of their respective order live together under the same sentence, isn&#8217;t it the evil one who always emerges? Is this not a mathematical law of linguistics? So, can I really blame my little community of outcasts for rejecting my attempt to unite when under the mandates of a ridged brain they were compelled to return to their ingrained thought patterns?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may now confirm that on a deeper level we are all unified. We are all part of the same God that created us. It is only the small time slot and location in which we materialize that determines our status among men. But our gift of free will is often, if not wholly confined to a material pursuit —- to be recognized, satisfied and relevant among our peers. That was my downfall. We are all outcasts of one society or another. Perhaps it was my mistake to attempt assimilation into a community where so little brain is enlisted and no mind exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But such is the story of human history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I re-enter the material world through a future earthly birth canal, of what flavor should I be? What race will dominate? What land will endow me riches. What sect will permit privileged indiscretions? And what tasks must I perform here in the subconscious waiting room to enter such a lofty lot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, dear reader, I can make that choice as we all may. Why is it then that I never realized I could make the most fundamental choice after I entered this last time?&#8211;my attitude.  Is it not true that we all possess a way out of these miseries with a simple change in attitude? Doesn&#8217;t such a simple and available act constitute a spiritual awakening?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must tell you the atheists here are in disarray. Some are so locked into their ridged lifetime collections of stubborn denial that they still roam the physical plane in misty apparitions. They embraced their stereotype and became comfortable with it-even dependent upon it. Now that is has been shattered, to accept it is to admit to the waste of en entire sojourn and that is just too much to ask of a closed mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observing them struggle with these realities I came to realize that I too, embraced my stereotypes. I behaved as if these stereotypes were my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still possess the glass with which I was born. It contains the elixir of life to its halfway mark. My material peers told me it was half empty and not having any reason to believe otherwise, I agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had I used my brain as intended I might have studied that glass for myself. I would have noticed that it was also half full. While the glass did not change, my attitude toward its contents would have and my life would have been worthwhile. I would not have been ashamed of my stereotypes. Indeed I would have rejected them. Nor could I have justified a quest for acceptance into a community of crazy white gentiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I am quite sure had I seen my glass as half full, I would have fallen to my knees to thank the One who filled it— even if only half way.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ll read this story in that coming lifetime. Perhaps I’ll chuckle at its absurd claims as I did this last life not understanding that it was I who wrote it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, the 2014 Election Campaign for the Republican Party was like the Seinfeld episode pitching George and Jerry&#8217;s TV show about &#8216;Nothing&#8217;.  Republicans, for the most part, kept their mouths shut and let the Democrats flail about with the War on Women, Birth Control, and How Great the Economy Is.  Yeah, good luck with those winning strategies, Dems&#8230;  </span></span></p>

								<p>At the higher levels of political office ideology is trumped by power. There are rare exceptions but generally, when a man is given a choice between utilizing and rejecting the power he is offered he will usually choose power. Even if he comes to office determined to do the people’s work he soon finds that this task will be difficult or perhaps dangerous if he bucks the entrenched corruption of his senior colleagues. He may fool himself into thinking he&#8217;ll go along until he acquires enough power to do his duty but he does not consider such an altruistic act requires him to relinquish the power he has accumulated. He has become addicted to the good life.</p>
<p>There is safety in numbers in the animal world and there is unaccountability in numbers in the political one. And so it is difficult for a man, even of good character to deny himself and his family the fortune available to him and the freedom to skirt the restrictions imposed on the rest of us when he becomes a member of the elite, untouchable ruling class. His self-centeredness, if he chooses to wield it, will not be so conspicuous in a sea of narcissists and any criticism of our man can be diluted by the sheer number of his clones. Once this elite rabble realizes it is untouchable, its corruption becomes blatant. There is no real need to pretend to serve except perhaps a few months before the next election.</p>
<p>But there are men of character able to resist the addiction of power and yield it benevolently. It was our good fortune to have many of them gathered at one place and at one time during our nation’s founding. That was a rare event. Today they are harder to find.</p>
<p>Mississippi Republicans with traditional values thought they had found one to represent them in the US Senate. We ran him and supported him against the corrupt machine and we beat the machine in the primaries. But we didn’t quite get to 50%, forcing a run-off. It stunned the machine. Fearing it could not win a run-off with voter appeal, it cheated and it did so blatantly. And why not? The machine extended into the courts and that’s where the voter fraud would be decided once the machine installed their corrupt man.</p>
<p>So what are the choices available to traditional Republican conservatives on November 4th? We may vote for the corrupt machine reasoning that Republicans need bodies to take over the Senate. We may vote for the Democrat to punish the machine and in turn punish ourselves. We may stay home in protest and let others decide our future. Or we could write in the name of our candidate we felt had enough character to do our work.</p>
<p>If we opt for the latter, under Mississippi law our vote will not count unless the machine’s candidate withdraws or dies just before the vote count.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the electorate—us. We must admit that many of us aren’t even aware of what our kids and grandkids are up to on facebook and that information is accessible with only a few clicks of a button. Can these same people actually know the issues in a political race? Others are more informed but only through ads between sitcom episodes. Still others are selectively informed, rejecting anything that their respective party machines tell them to.</p>
<p>Then there are well-informed voters seeking out on their own efforts the idiosyncrasies of public policy and the forethought to think them through. If you are among the latter, you are more concerned with your freedom than your fortune. You must be because you know that once our freedom disappears our fortune is up for grabs. And our freedom is leaving on the express train.</p>
<p>So how does a traditional conservative vote this November? As one myself, I shall say only how I will vote. I will not vote for the Republican machine because I am trying to build my character, something I demand of my representatives. It will not be a protest vote, a revenge vote or any other emotional act. It will simply be a refusal on my part to support corruption.</p>
<p>I will not vote for the Democrat machine because it is the greater of two evils and has been for 40 plus years. I will not stay home because that truly is a wasted vote. I will write in my candidate’s name, Chris McDaniel, careful to spell it correctly and make it very legible.</p>
<p>I will do this even though it will not count. It will not count just as the Declaration of Independence didn’t count at the time it was penned. It didn’t count until 7 years after its creation when men of character fought to make it count. If they had failed, it would have just been another piece of philosophical parchment with a 2 inch reference in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>If I want character at the top, I must show it at the bottom. I will never again vote for the lesser of two evils. I will vote <strong><em>for</em></strong> a candidate from now on even if I have to draw my own line on the ballot and put my dead daddy’s name on it.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif">First, to make sure we do everything possible to care safely and effectively for this individual. </span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif">Second, assessing her possible contacts from the moment she developed symptoms. And the CDC team lead has investigated her. It appears at this time there&#8217;s only one contact that may have had contact with her while she may have been infectious. That individual is under active monitoring. </span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif">Third, we are evaluating other potential health care worker exposures because if this individual was exposed, which they were, it is possible that other individuals were exposed. We know that this individual did provide care to the index patient on multiple occasions and that care included extensive contact. </span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif">Fourth, we will undertake a complete investigation of how this may have occurred. That&#8217;s so important so we can understand it better and intervene to prevent this happening in the future. </span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small">I want to go into a little bit more detail first on what we are doing to promote safe and effective care and then on the investigation. In terms of safe and effective care, we had already begun several days ago<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> <i>[<b>MoosNote:</b>  So &#8216;safe care&#8217; training BEGAN after the &#8216;Index Patient&#8217; died?  That&#8217;s like training the Fire Department how to use the pumper trucks after a building burns down and is already spreading to the local orphanage next door&#8230;]</i></span> to ramp up the education and training of health care workers at <b>this facility</b><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><i> [<b>MoosNote:</b>  Um, how about all the OTHER facilities which will see Ebola patients coming in?].</i></span>  </span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small"><b>The care of Ebola can be done safely, but it is hard to do it safely.</b> It requires meticulous and scrupulous attention to infection control, and even a single inadvertent innocent slip can result in contamination.  <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> <i>[<b>MoosNote: </b> But a week ago Dr. Frieden said you could sit on a bus next to someone with Ebola and be safe???  <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/10/03/ebola-how-it-spreads" target="_blank">Yes, he actually DID say this</a>]</i></span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small"><b>Second, we are recommending to the facility that the number of workers who care for anyone with suspected Ebola be kept to an absolute minimum.</b>   <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>[<b>MoosNote:</b>  Later in this briefing he went on to say that they are now monitoring 48 OTHER health care providers who had access to this patient &#8211; 48 providers is the absolute MINIMUM required to keep one person alive???  Or not, in the case of the &#8216;Index Patient&#8217;.]</i></span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small"><b>Third, we recommend that the procedures that are undertaken to support the care of that individual be limited solely to essential procedures. </b><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><i> [<b>MoosNote:</b>  Would I be too cruel to whittle down the list of &#8216;essential procedures&#8217; to a list of a single item?

<li><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small"><b>Fourth, we&#8217;re looking at personal protective equipment, understanding that there is a balance and putting more on isn&#8217;t always safer, it may make it harder to provide effective care. </b>So all aspects of personal protective equipment.   <i><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[<b>MoosNote:</b>  Roughly translated, this means that the CDC needs more money from Congress to continue their &#8216;Good Work&#8217; protecting all of us from deadly diseases before they get to the United States, um, never mind, they&#8217;re already here&#8230;]</span></i></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif"><span style="font-size: small"><b>And fifth, we are recommending there be a full time individual who is responsible only for the oversight, supervision and monitoring of effective infection control while an Ebola patient is cared for.</b> CDC has sent additional staff to Texas to assist with this response and we will continue to work closely with them.</span></span>  <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>[<b>MoosNote: </b> Once again, the image a fully-involved orphanage in the midst of a fire should spring to mind here&#8230;]</i></span></li>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There were many, many other words inarticulately spoken by Dr. Frienden, but the bottom line is this:  Ebola is here and we are doing very little to prevent other &#8216;Clusters of Infection&#8217; from occurring in Texas, or any other State of the Union.  One patient with Ebola shut down the Dallas health care system, what about other cases which will occur across the country? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why won&#8217;t we try to prevent potentially-infected travelers from coming here?  I honestly don&#8217;t know.  Maybe because he feels that cutting off travel from Africa is &#8216;Racist&#8217;?  While Dr. Frieden was the head of the New York City DOHMH from 2002–2009 he had NO problem whatsoever for the elimination of trans-fats in food preparation, the limitations on the size of &#8216;sugary&#8217; drinks you can buy, and he even introduced the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYC_Condom" target="_blank">NYC Condom</a>&#8221; (it&#8217;s the official condom of the Big Apple!) &#8211; he has no problems with putting restrictions on anyone else&#8217;s lifestyle, yet he has <b><span style="font-size: x-large">NOT</span></b> called for the restriction of flights from infected areas originating in West Africa to the United States?  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, Dr. Frieden, will save you from Sugary Drinks in New York City but when it comes to potentially-fatal infectious diseases, you&#8217;re pretty much on your own.  AND when asked why you can&#8217;t shut down travel between &#8216;infected places&#8217; and HERE, well, the folks at Politico.com covered it this way&#8230;</span></p>
