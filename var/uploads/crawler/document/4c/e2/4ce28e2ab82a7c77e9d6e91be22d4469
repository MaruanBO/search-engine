                    <p>Which is what I’ll be sharing with you in just a few moments. First, I’d like to introduce you to someone I’m very proud of, my sister Lisa because to be perfectly honest, she is the real reason I was even studying the female metabolism so passionately in the first place.</p>
                    <p>You see, Lisa has always been one of the most important women in my life. Ever since we were kids she’s always looked out for me and has been there for me when I needed anything. She really is the best sister a brother could ask for. And when my sister reached out to me for help with her weight, I felt like the worst failure in the world when I couldn’t help her.</p>
                    <p>You see, none of my degrees, experience or world class certifications gave me what I needed to help Lisa achieve the true, long term weight loss she deserved the way I’ve been fortunate enough to have been able to do for thousands of men across the globe including myself with the cutting edge programs I’ve authored.</p>
                    <p>And to see my sister whom I absolutely adore suffer with her health and negative self-image issues because of her weight was heart-breaking. It got to the point she seemed ashamed to even order food at restaurants. Yet, I sincerely believed with all of my heart if she could solve her weight problem, it would positively affect every part of her life and relationships like it did for me.</p>

                    <p>Now our family comes from a long line of “bad genetics” and I know exactly what it feels like to hate the overweight reflection looking back in the bathroom mirror. And I would have given anything to have what worked for me work for Lisa. But it didn’t. And after Lisa had my niece Paige, things got even worse for her. She was tipping the scales at 210 pounds, which at 5 foot 1, was dangerously unhealthy... and emotionally she was totally depressed because she thought she had tried everything.</p>
                    <p>I remember it was a Monday afternoon, almost 2 years after Lisa had Paige, when I stumbled upon research leading to female fat loss loopholes unlike anything I’d ever imagined. Loopholes that would ultimately allow Lisa to shed a breathtaking 53 pounds of undesirable body fat!</p>
                    <p>However, as impressive as that was, what stands out the most to her family and friends is that her physical transformation led to a personal transformation that finally enabled her to live as the confident, proud, beautiful woman we always saw her to be.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 21px;">Science has now discovered that virtually everything to do with weight loss for both men and women is controlled by one master hormone.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 18px; width:85%">This hormone that controls <span class="underline">100% of your body’s ability</span> to burn fat is Leptin.</p>
                            <p class="underline">You may not know how Leptin works, so let me quickly explain:</p>
                            <p>High levels of Leptin speed up your metabolism and signal your body to burn fat and low levels of Leptin slow down your metabolism and signal your body to store fat. Those are the basics, now get ready for some surprising facts regarding Women and Leptin.</p>
                            <p><strong>Researchers recently discovered that women naturally have twice as much of the fat burning hormone Leptin in their body compared to men.</strong></p>
                            <p>That’s the good news!</p>
                            <p>However, brand new research revealed the following bad news that explains why women can struggle so much to lose unattractive body fat and keep it off:</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="span3">
                            <h1 class="white">1.</h1>
                            <div>
                                <span>Women can be 3 times less responsive to Leptin’s signal to burn fat than men. This means even though women have a lot more Leptin they just aren’t using its fat burning potential. This condition is known as “Leptin Resistance”. An obvious sign of Leptin resistance is the soft, squishy, cottage-cheese looking fat found in your problem areas. However, Leptin Resistance is just 1 of 2 unique problems that kills female fat loss.</span>

                            <div>
                                <span>The second unique problem women face with Leptin is that when dieting, your Leptin levels can drop twice as much and twice as fast compared to when men diet. As talked about, when Leptin drops your metabolism hits the brakes and slows right down. This is exactly why you experience frustrating weight loss plateaus on diets so much faster than men.</span>

It was depressing, frustrating and exhausting. And now? I have a six pack and slim and toned body that I can sustain all year round, but I wouldn’t be able to do that if it wasn’t for Venus Index Workout and the girls in the community.</p>
