Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland's Governor is Paul de Jersey, and the Premier is Campbell Newman of the Liberal National Party of Queensland.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":19,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJt","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4447\/","latitude":-22.5681,"id":4447,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/queensland-au\/","kind":"location","category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4447","active":true,"slug":"queensland-au","links":"","recent_count":4,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/04\/Flag_of_Queensland.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queensland\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Queensland, AU","item_count":162},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T23:06:57","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4448","local_url":"\/topic\/cyclones\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone","woeid":null,"description":"<p>In meteorology, a <b>cyclone<\/b> is an area of closed, circular fluid motion rotating in the same direction as the Earth. This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"id":4448,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","kind":"tag","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","recent_count":7,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":52,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","latitude":null,"id":121,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","kind":"vertical","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","active":true,"slug":"weather","links":"","recent_count":11,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"weather","item_count":27530}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/rt-abcnews24-breaking-severe-cyclonemarcia-i","url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Cyclone Marcia begins to cross Queensland's Capricorn coast, carrying wind gusts up to 177 mph - @ABCNews24","updated_date":"2015-02-19T21:42:06.100842","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKmf","importance":3,"media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/rt-abcnews24-breaking-severe-cyclonemarcia-i","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"slug":"rt-abcnews24-breaking-severe-cyclonemarcia-i","id":517483,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"partner","whoas":4},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vLqWkI","date":"2015-02-19T21:35:33.313261","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/478953788913352704\/TLcYGh76_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"LVMPD","date":"2015-02-19T21:18:06","resource_uri":"","content":"LVMPD Homicide detectives have arrested the suspect in the February 12th road rage shooting incident. http:\/\/t.co\/gnSKokTNaZ","id":309760,"tweet_id":"568519923216957440","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LVMPD\/status\/568519923216957440","user_id":"26303146","name":"LVMPD","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 09:35 PM GMT","data":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517477\/","type":"text","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LVMPD\/status\/568519923216957440\/photo\/1","source":null,"push_content":"Photo: Detectives in Las Vegas with the suspect in the Feb. 12 road rage shooting incident - @LVMPD","topics":[{"longitude":-115.14,"created_on":"2012-05-09T16:03:16","placetype":"Town","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=476","local_url":"\/topic\/las-vegas-nv-us\/","geohash":"9qqjgbvsedck","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Las_Vegas","woeid":2436704,"description":"<p><b>Las Vegas<\/b>, \/lɑːs ˈveɪɡəs\/ (locally, also pronounced as \/lɑːs ˈvɛɡɨs\/) officially the <b>City of Las Vegas<\/b> and often known as simply <b>Vegas<\/b>, is the most populous city in the state of Nevada and the county seat of Clark County.

Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and borders the U.S. states of New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, and Louisiana to the east. Texas has an area of 268,820 square miles (696,200 km<sup>2<\/sup>) and a growing population of over 26.4 million residents (July 2013).<\/p>\n<p>Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the United States, while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest United States metropolitan areas, respectively. Other major cities include El Paso and Austin—the state capital. Texas is nicknamed the <i>Lone Star State<\/i> to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The \"Lone Star\" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today. The origin of the state name, Texas, is from the word, \"Tejas\", which means 'friends' in the Caddo language.<\/p>\n<p>Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest. Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts, less than 10 percent of the land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The term \"six flags over Texas\", as can be seen in the Grand Prairie-based large national and international amusement park operator <i>Six Flags<\/i>, came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony in Texas. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic. In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican–American War in 1846. A slave state, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the \"Confederate States of America\" on March 2 of the same year. After the consequent Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.<\/p>\n<p>One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle. Due to its long history as a center of the industry, Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy. The state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century, when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PJ","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/939\/","latitude":31.1689,"id":939,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/texas-us\/","kind":"location","category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=939","active":true,"slug":"texas-us","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Flag_of_Texas.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Texas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Texas, US","item_count":1731},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-12-20T13:38:17.066631","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=51972","local_url":"\/topic\/gay-rights\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Laws<\/b> affecting <b>lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender<\/b> (<b>LGBT<\/b>) people vary greatly by country or territory—everything from legal recognition of same-sex marriage or other types of partnerships, to the death penalty as punishment for same-sex romantic\/sexual activity or identity.<\/p>\n<p>LGBT rights are considered human rights and civil rights.

Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is sometimes referred to as <b>marriage equality<\/b> or <b>equal marriage<\/b>, particularly by supporters. The legalization of same-sex marriage is characterized as \"redefining marriage\" by many opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. As of 28 June 2014, sixteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, Uruguay) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of Mexico and the United States) allow same-sex couples to marry. The law in Luxembourg will come into force on 1 January 2015. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via a ballot initiative or a referendum). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, human rights and civil rights issue, as well as a religious issue in many nations and around the world, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, or instead be allowed to hold a different status (a civil union), or be denied such rights. Same-sex marriage can provide same-sex couples who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of opposite-sex married couples. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex couples benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions. Court documents filed by American scientific associations also state that singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them. The American Anthropological Association avers that social science research does not support the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon not recognizing same-sex marriage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting. Various faith communities around the world support allowing same-sex couples to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: Buddhism in Australia, Church of Sweden, Conservative Judaism, U.S. Episcopalians, Humanistic Judaism, Native American religions with a two-spirit tradition, Druids, the Metropolitan Community Church, Quakers, Reconstructionist Judaism, Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalists, the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, and Wiccans, as well as various other progressive and modern Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish groups and various minor religions and other denominations.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B1","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/115\/","latitude":null,"id":115,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/same-sex-marriage\/","kind":"tag","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=115","active":true,"slug":"same-sex-marriage","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ed\/Major_Alan_G._Roger_at_Same-Sex_Wedding_Ceremony.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Same-sex_marriage\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"same-sex marriage","item_count":983},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-06-25T16:04:26","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=37883","local_url":"\/topic\/texas-supreme-court\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supreme_Court_of_Texas","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Supreme Court of Texas<\/b> is the court of last resort for civil matters (including juvenile delinquency which the law considers to be a civil matter and not criminal) in the state of Texas.

The capital, Baghdad, is in the center of the country. Around 97% of the country's 36,000,000 people are Muslims, mainly Shias, Sunnis, and ethnic Kurds.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf and its territory encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through the center of Iraq and flow into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. Theses rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.<\/p>\n<p>The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as Mesopotamia and thought to be the birthplace of writing and the world's oldest civilizations. The area has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of Sèvres. Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States of America and its allies, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held. The American presence in Iraq ended in 2011 but the Iraqi insurgency continued and intensified as fighters from the Syrian Civil War spilled into the country.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EU","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/268\/","latitude":33.2405,"id":268,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/iraq\/","kind":"location","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=268","active":true,"slug":"iraq","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f6\/Flag_of_Iraq.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iraq\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Iraq","item_count":2337},{"longitude":43.137,"created_on":"2010-06-14T08:14:51","placetype":"Town","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=424","local_url":"\/topic\/mosul-ninawa-iq\/","geohash":"syqwtwemsuns","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mosul","woeid":1979409,"description":"<p><\/p>\n<p><b>Mosul<\/b> (Arabic: الموصل‎ <i>al-Mawṣil<\/i>; North Mesopotamian Arabic: <i>el-Mōṣul<\/i>; Syriac: ܢܝܢܘܐ <i>Nînwe<\/i>; Kurdish: <i>Mûsil\/Nînewe<\/i>; Turkmen: <i>Musul<\/i>) is a city in northern Iraq and the capital of the Nineveh Province, some 400 km (250 mi) northwest of Baghdad.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","latitude":37.1679,"id":10,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","kind":"location","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","active":true,"slug":"united-states","links":"","recent_count":3,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"United States","item_count":15934},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals suitable for transmission via cables or other transmission media over long distances, and replays such signals simultaneously in audible form to its user. The word <i>telephone<\/i> has been adapted into the vocabulary of many languages. It is derived from the Greek: τῆλε, <i>tēle<\/i>, \"far\" and φωνή, <i>phōnē<\/i>, \"voice\", together meaning \"distant voice\".<\/p>\r\n<p>First patented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and further developed by many others, the telephone was the first device in history that enabled people to talk directly with each other across large distances. Telephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses, government, and households, and are today some of the most widely used small appliances.<\/p>\r\n<p>The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (<i>transmitter<\/i>) to speak into and an earphone (<i>receiver<\/i>) which reproduces the voice of the distant person. In addition, most telephones contain a <i>ringer<\/i> which produces a sound to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial used to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. Until approximately the 1970s most telephones used a rotary dial, which was superseded by the modern DTMF push-button dial, first introduced by AT&amp;T in 1963. The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset, or on a base unit to which the handset is connected by a cord containing wires. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telephone network to the receiving phone. The receiving telephone converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver, or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones are a duplex communications medium, meaning they allow the people on both ends to talk simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<p>A landline telephone is connected by a pair of wires to the telephone network, while a mobile phone, such as a cellular phone, is portable and communicates with the telephone network by radio transmissions. A cordless telephone has a portable handset which communicates by radio transmission with the handset base station which is connected by wire to the telephone network.<\/p>\r\n<p>The public switched telephone network, consisting of telephone lines, fiberoptic cables, microwave transmission, cellular networks, communications satellites, and undersea telephone cables connected by switching centers, allows telephones around the world to communicate with each other. Each telephone line has an identifying telephone number. To initiate a telephone call the user enters the other telephone's number into a numeric keypad on the phone. Graphic symbols used to designate telephone service or phone-related information in print, signage, and other media include ℡ (U+2121), <big>☎<\/big> (U+260E), <big>☏<\/big> (U+260F), <big>✆<\/big> (U+2706), and <big>⌕<\/big> (U+2315).<\/p>\r\n<p>Although originally designed for simple voice communications, most modern telephones have many additional capabilities. They may be able to record spoken messages, send and receive text messages, take and display photographs or video, play music, and surf the Internet. A current trend is phones that integrate all mobile communication and computing needs; these are called smartphones.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Wfd","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/86519\/","latitude":null,"id":86519,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/telephones\/","kind":"tag","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=86519","active":true,"slug":"telephones","links":"","recent_count":3,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/74\/Alt_Telefon.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Telephone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"telephones","item_count":367},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","woeid":null,"description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","latitude":null,"id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","kind":"vertical","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","active":true,"slug":"tech","links":"","recent_count":7,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"tech","item_count":8413}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/david-thodey-announces-retirement-as-ceo-of-austra","url_domain":null,"content":"David Thodey announces retirement as CEO of Australian mobile phone provider Telstra; CFO Andrew Penn to replace him - @SkyNewsAust","updated_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:21.212464","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKmH","importance":2,"media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/david-thodey-announces-retirement-as-ceo-of-austra","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"slug":"david-thodey-announces-retirement-as-ceo-of-austra","id":517459,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":3},{"shortened_url":null,"date":"2015-02-19T21:18:09.987390","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 09:18 PM GMT","data":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517455\/","type":"text","url":"","source":null,"push_content":"Shares for retail giant Nordstrom drop 3% after profit, forecast fall short of estimates - @Marketwatch","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","local_url":"\/topic\/earnings\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Earnings","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Earnings<\/b> are the net benefits of a corporation's operation.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":61,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","latitude":null,"id":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","kind":"vertical","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","active":true,"slug":"crime-courts","links":"","recent_count":14,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:35:33.313261","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"crime & courts","item_count":52076},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-05-20T04:40:16.582929","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=66484","local_url":"\/topic\/travel\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travel","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by McGraw-Hill Financial, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow.<\/p>\n<p>The <i>Industrial<\/i> portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P 500 Index, and the Russell 2000 Index, the Dow is among the most closely watched U.S. benchmark indices tracking targeted stock market activity. Components of the Dow trade on both the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. Derivatives of the Dow trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and through the CME Group, the world's largest futures exchange company. CME Group owns 24.4% of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the Industrial Average.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":2,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/M","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/12\/","latitude":null,"id":12,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/dow-30\/","kind":"tag","category":"MarketIndex","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=12","active":true,"slug":"dow-30","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:08:41.176081","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/eb\/DJIA_historical_graph_to_jan09_%28log%29.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Dow Jones Industrial Average","item_count":1548},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:44:19","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=13","local_url":"\/topic\/nasdaq\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NASDAQ","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>NASDAQ Stock Market<\/b> (\/ˈnæzˌdæk\/), commonly known as the <b>NASDAQ<\/b>, is an American stock exchange.

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","latitude":null,"id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","kind":"vertical","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","active":true,"slug":"tech","links":"","recent_count":7,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"tech","item_count":8413}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/stocks-close-mostly-lower-with-dow-down-44-points","url_domain":"usatoday.com","content":"Stocks close mostly lower with Dow down 44 points; tech stocks push Nasdaq higher for 7th straight day - @USATODAYmoney","updated_date":"2015-02-19T21:08:43.971780","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKl1","importance":4,"media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/stocks-close-mostly-lower-with-dow-down-44-points","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"slug":"stocks-close-mostly-lower-with-dow-down-44-points","id":517443,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":4},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/reut.rs\/1EaNd2n","date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556153632207286272\/vingsqa1_normal.png","screen_name":"ReutersUS","date":"2015-02-19T20:20:38","resource_uri":"","content":"Removed from ventilator, Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition unchanged: source http:\/\/t.co\/cbDpR8GTMY","id":309729,"tweet_id":"568505461135306752","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReutersUS\/status\/568505461135306752","user_id":"15108530","name":"Reuters U.S. News","location":""},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 09:05 PM GMT","data":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517440\/","type":"text","url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/02\/19\/us-people-brown-idUSKBN0LN24520150219?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews","source":null,"push_content":"Bobbi Kristina Brown is removed from ventilator; her condition unchanged, source says - @ReutersUS","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-31T18:02:35.433704","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=149482","local_url":"\/topic\/bobbi-kristina-brown-hospitalized\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/m3A","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/149482\/","latitude":null,"id":149482,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bobbi-kristina-brown-hospitalized\/","kind":"arc","category":"EntertainmentEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=149482","active":true,"slug":"bobbi-kristina-brown-hospitalized","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Bobbi Kristina Brown hospitalized","item_count":15},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-03-08T17:41:39","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=18882","local_url":"\/topic\/bobbi-kristina-brown\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whitney_Houston","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Whitney Elizabeth Houston<\/b> (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, <i>Guinness World Records<\/i> cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston was one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 200 million records worldwide. She released six studio albums, one holiday album and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for \"How Will I Know\", influenced several African American women artists who follow in her footsteps.<\/p>\n<p>Houston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1 <i>Billboard<\/i> Hot 100 hits. She is the second artist behind Elton John and the only woman to have two number-one <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 Album awards (formerly \"Top Pop Albums\") on the <i>Billboard<\/i> magazine year-end charts. Houston's 1985 debut album <i>Whitney Houston<\/i> became the best-selling debut album by a woman in history. <i>Rolling Stone<\/i> named it the best album of 1986, and ranked it at number 254 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Her second studio album <i>Whitney<\/i> (1987) became the first album by a woman to debut at number one on the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 albums chart.<\/p>\n<p>Houston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film <i>The Bodyguard<\/i> (1992). The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its lead single, \"I Will Always Love You\", became the best-selling single by a woman in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under Nielsen SoundScan system. The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films <i>Waiting to Exhale<\/i> (1995) and <i>The Preacher's Wife<\/i> (1996). <i>The Preacher's Wife<\/i> soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album in history.<\/p>\n<p>On February 11, 2012, Houston was found dead in her guest room at The Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills, California. The official coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards and featured prominently in American and international media.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/E4i","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/18882\/","latitude":null,"id":18882,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bobbi-kristina-brown\/","kind":"tag","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=18882","active":true,"slug":"bobbi-kristina-brown","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Whitney_Houston_Welcome_Home_Heroes_1_cropped.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whitney_Houston\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Bobbi Kristina Brown","item_count":28},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-02-28T20:13:12.820333","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=57457","local_url":"\/topic\/celebrities\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Celebrity","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Celebrity<\/b> refers to popular fame and public attention in the media, usually applied to a person, or group of people (celebrity couple, family etc.), or occasionally, to animals or fictional entities.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":8,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","latitude":null,"id":75,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","kind":"vertical","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","active":true,"slug":"entertainment","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"entertainment","item_count":8463}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/bobbi-kristina-brown-is-removed-from-ventilator-h","url_domain":"reuters.com","content":"Bobbi Kristina Brown is removed from ventilator; her condition unchanged, source says - @ReutersUS","updated_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:55.722626","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKly","importance":3,"media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/bobbi-kristina-brown-is-removed-from-ventilator-h","author":{"full_name":"Tom Brew","id":7,"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Tom"},"note":null,"slug":"bobbi-kristina-brown-is-removed-from-ventilator-h","id":517440,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":20},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vLkfit","date":"2015-02-19T20:59:27.163353","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/567814511394951168\/gD2acb5r_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"kudialisRJ","date":"2015-02-19T20:40:43","resource_uri":"","content":"Man being pulled out of surrounded residence by police.

To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"id":4448,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","kind":"tag","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","recent_count":7,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.

Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city known primarily for gambling, shopping, fine dining and nightlife and is the leading financial and cultural center for Southern Nevada. The city bills itself as The Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its mega casino–hotels and associated entertainment. A growing retirement and family city, Las Vegas is the 31st-most populous city in the United States, with a population at the 2010 census of 583,756. The 2010 population of the Las Vegas metropolitan area was 1,951,269. The city is one of the top three leading destinations in the United States for conventions, business and meetings. Today, Las Vegas is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Established in 1905, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, Las Vegas was the most populous American city founded in that century (a distinction held by Chicago in the 19th century).

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria.

The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.

Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.

The Port of Oakland is the busiest port for San Francisco Bay and all of Northern California. Oakland is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city in the state, and the 47th-largest city in the U.S. with a population at the 2010 U.S. Census of 390,724. Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda County. It serves as a major transportation hub and trade center for the entire region and is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles (9.7 km) east of San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile industry. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>A steady influx of immigrants during the 20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, have made Oakland one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. Oakland is known for its history of political activism, as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which include health care, dot-com companies and manufacturers of household products. The city is a transportation hub for the greater Bay Area, and its shipping port is the fifth busiest in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Oakland has a Mediterranean climate with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt, a large estuary centrally located east of Downtown, was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge. Jack London Square, named for the author and former resident, is a tourist destination on the Oakland waterfront.<\/p>\n<p>Much progress has been made in reducing the city's high crime rate; violent crime is primarily concentrated in certain neighborhoods, and property crime has declined throughout the city. Oakland is continually listed among the top cities in the United States for sustainability practices, including a No. 1 ranking for usage of electricity from renewable resources. Significant portions of Oakland suffer from severe lead contamination.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.0 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.<\/p>\n<p>A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the three-point line, and three points (known commonly as a <i>3 pointer<\/i> or <i>three<\/i>) if the player is behind the three-point line. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a draw. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a team mate. It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.<\/p>\n<p>Violations are called \"fouls\". A personal foul is penalized, and a free throw is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball. A technical foul may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of a player or coach. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team also retains possession of the ball.<\/p>\n<p>As well as many techniques for shooting, passing, dribbling and rebounding, basketball has specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning). Typically, the tallest and strongest members of a team will play the center or power forward positions, while slightly shorter and more agile players will play small forward, and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills and speed play point guard or shooting guard.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":10,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cm","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/162\/","latitude":null,"id":162,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/basketball\/","kind":"tag","category":"Sport","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=162","active":true,"slug":"basketball","links":"","recent_count":5,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T20:38:37.976638","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c3\/Jordan_by_Lipofsky_16577.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Basketball\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"basketball","item_count":1704},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-07-06T02:20:17","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=12351","local_url":"\/topic\/houston-rockets\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Houston_Rockets","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Houston Rockets<\/b> are an American professional basketball team based in Houston, Texas. The team plays in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1967 and played in San Diego, California, for four years as the <b>San Diego Rockets<\/b>, before moving to Houston.<\/p>\n<p>In the Rockets' debut season, they won only 15 games. But after drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1969 NBA Draft, they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969. After Hayes was traded, Moses Malone was later acquired to replace him. Malone went on to win the MVP award twice, and lead Houston to the conference finals in his first year with the team. He also took the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, but they were defeated in six games by Larry Bird's Boston Celtics which also featured the Rockets current head coach, Kevin McHale.<\/p>\n<p>In 1984, the Rockets drafted Hakeem Olajuwon who, paired with Ralph Sampson and both collectively known as the \"Twin Towers\", led them to the 1986 Finals in their second and third year respectively, where in another brave effort they lost again to the Boston Celtics. In the next seven seasons, plagued by injury including to Sampson who would be traded in 1988, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times, until finally advancing in 1993 with a re-tooled roster past the L.A. Clippers and battle the rival Seattle SuperSonics to the bitter end before falling short in an overtime Game 7. Inspired by the tough playoff defeat, Olajuwon famously proclaimed to the team \"We go from here.\" The Rockets stormed all the way to the 1994 NBA Finals, where Olajuwon led them to the franchise's first championship against his rival Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks. The team repeated as champions in 1995 with a memorable run as the 6th seed in the West and sweeping the favored Orlando Magic led by a young Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. After winning two championships, the Rockets traded away most of the championship team for Charles Barkley, changed their championship uniforms, and, to date, have not advanced to the finals again. They missed the playoffs from 2000–2003 and did not reach the playoffs again until they drafted Yao Ming, and did not advance past the first round of the playoffs again until 2009. The Rockets narrowly missed the playoffs the following three seasons. After Yao Ming's retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster.

The Knicks are part of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, above Pennsylvania Station in the borough of Manhattan, and along with the Boston Celtics is one of only two NBA teams still located in its original city.<\/p>\n<p>The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.<\/p>\n<p>The playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by three passionate rivalries with Alonzo Mourning's Miami Heat, Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, and Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. During this time, they were well known for displaying tough defense under head coach Pat Riley before Jeff Van Gundy assumed head coaching responsibilities in 1995. Their success during this decade was highlighted by two appearances in the NBA Finals, in 1994 and 1999. Despite being a consistent playoff contender, they never attained an NBA Championship in their two championship appearances.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former glory, advancing to the postseason five times in the last 14 years. Notably, in 2012–13 the franchise won its first division title in 19 years, but were eliminated in the second round by the Pacers. According to <i>Forbes<\/i>, the Knicks are the most valuable NBA team, worth approximately $1.4 billion U.S.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ga","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/398\/","latitude":null,"id":398,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-knicks\/","kind":"tag","category":"SportsTeam","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=398","active":true,"slug":"new-york-knicks","links":"","recent_count":1,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T20:38:37.976638","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/d\/d8\/NewYorkKnicks.PNG","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_Knicks\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"New York Knicks","item_count":84},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-19T20:31:54.051405","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=259222","local_url":"\/topic\/pablo-prigioni\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pablo_Prigioni","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Pablo Prigioni<\/b> (born May 17, 1977) is an Argentine-Italian professional basketball player who plays for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news.

A World Health Organization report released April 30, 2014 states, \"this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability, and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile, and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second- and even third-line antibiotics is, thus, sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> in some nosocomial settings. Some pathogens, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i>, also possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.<\/p>\r\n<p>It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the acquisition of resistance genes from other bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer via conjugation, transduction, or transformation. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids, facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>, the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis, since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. Also <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i> lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.<\/p>\r\n<p>Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and veterinary medicine. Any use of antibiotics can increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies, there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs. Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection; of these, MRSA is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus<\/i>), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus<\/i>), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus<\/i>) and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii<\/i>) are prominent examples. Nosocomial infections overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly common in the community.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/HAD","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/26911\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/superbug\/","livevideo":"","category":"MedicalCondition","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=26911","active":true,"slug":"superbug","links":"","id":26911,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T00:34:22.571020","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/20\/Antibiotic_sensitvity_and_resistance.JPG","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antibiotic_resistance\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"superbugs","item_count":16},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

A World Health Organization report released April 30, 2014 states, \"this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability, and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile, and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second- and even third-line antibiotics is, thus, sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> in some nosocomial settings. Some pathogens, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i>, also possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.<\/p>\r\n<p>It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the acquisition of resistance genes from other bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer via conjugation, transduction, or transformation. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids, facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>, the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis, since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. Also <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i> lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.<\/p>\r\n<p>Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and veterinary medicine. Any use of antibiotics can increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies, there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs. Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection; of these, MRSA is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus<\/i>), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus<\/i>), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus<\/i>) and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii<\/i>) are prominent examples. Nosocomial infections overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly common in the community.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/HAD","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/26911\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/superbug\/","livevideo":"","category":"MedicalCondition","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=26911","active":true,"slug":"superbug","links":"","id":26911,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T00:34:22.571020","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/20\/Antibiotic_sensitvity_and_resistance.JPG","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antibiotic_resistance\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"superbugs","item_count":16},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring.

The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes also loosely applied to the whole state), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"primary":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","latitude":54.3141,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","active":true,"slug":"united-kingdom","links":"","id":30,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:10:44.553521","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Scotland%29.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"United Kingdom","item_count":7328},{"longitude":-4.93986,"created_on":"2012-04-09T17:23:31","placetype":"County","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3144","local_url":"\/topic\/cornwall-and-isles-of-scilly-england-gb\/","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":12602181,"description":"","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/ys","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3144\/","latitude":50.4433,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cornwall-and-isles-of-scilly-england-gb\/","livevideo":"","category":"County","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=3144","active":true,"slug":"cornwall-and-isles-of-scilly-england-gb","links":"","id":3144,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T09:54:27.856744","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, England, GB","item_count":31},{"longitude":108.831,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:27","placetype":"Country","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87","local_url":"\/topic\/russia\/","geohash":"y6t6hx0r6pe7","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia","woeid":23424936,"description":"<p><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Russia<\/b> \/ˈrʌʃə\/ or \/ˈrʊʃə\/ (Russian: Россия, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossiya<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small>[rɐˈsʲijə]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially known as the <b>Russian Federation<\/b> (Russian: Российская Федерация, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossiyskaya Federatsiya<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small>[rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈrat͡sɨjə]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), is a country in northern Eurasia. It is a federal semi-presidential republic. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk, the US state of Alaska across the Bering Strait and Canada's Arctic islands. At 17,075,400 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's ninth most populous nation with 143 million people as of 2012. Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans nine time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North America.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a recognized superpower, which played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite, and the first man in space. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality of the Union state.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the ninth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2014.

For other uses of Eurofighter, see Eurofighter (disambiguation).<\/i><\/dd>\n<\/dl><p>The <b>Eurofighter Typhoon<\/b> is a twin-engine, canard-delta wing, multirole fighter. The Typhoon was designed and is manufactured by a consortium of three companies; BAE Systems, Airbus Group and Alenia Aermacchi, who conduct the majority of affairs dealing with the project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, which was formed in 1986. The project is managed by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, which also acts as the prime customer.<\/p>\n<p>Development of the aircraft effectively began in 1983 with the <i>Future European Fighter Aircraft<\/i> programme, a multinational collaborative effort between the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Due to disagreements over design authority and operational requirements, France left the consortium to independently develop the Dassault Rafale instead. A technology demonstration aircraft, the British Aerospace EAP, first took flight on 6 August 1986; the first prototype of the finalised Eurofighter made its first flight on 27 March 1994. The name of the aircraft, Typhoon, was formally adopted in September 1998; the first production contracts were signed that same year.<\/p>\n<p>Political issues in the partner nations significantly protracted the Typhoon's development; the sudden end of the Cold War reduced European demand for fighter aircraft, and there was debate over the cost and work share of the Eurofighter. The Typhoon was introduced into operational service in 2003. Currently, the type has entered service with the Austrian Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the German Air Force, the Royal Air Force, the Spanish Air Force, and the Royal Saudi Air Force. The Royal Air Force of Oman has also been confirmed as an export customer, bringing the procurement total to 571 aircraft as of 2013.<\/p>\n<p>The Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed to be an effective dogfighter when in combat with other aircraft; later production aircraft have been increasingly more well-equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment. The Typhoon saw its combat debut during the 2011 military intervention in Libya with the Royal Air Force and the Italian Air Force, performing reconnaissance and ground strike missions. The type has also taken primary responsibility for air defence duties for the majority of customer nations.<\/p>","daily_count":2,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LfX","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/44229\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/eurofighter-typhoon\/","livevideo":"","category":"Vehicle","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=44229","active":true,"slug":"eurofighter-typhoon","links":"","id":44229,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:10:44.553521","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/64\/RSAF_Typhoon_at_Malta_-_Gordon_Zammit.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eurofighter_Typhoon\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Eurofighter Typhoon","item_count":7},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-03-21T17:05:13","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2680","local_url":"\/topic\/royal-air-force\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Air_Force","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Royal Air Force<\/b> (<b>RAF<\/b>) is the aerial warfare service branch of the British Armed Forces. Formed toward the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged – at the time – the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.<\/p>\n<p>The RAF's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence (MoD), which are to \"provide the capabilities needed: to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories, including against terrorism; to support the Government’s foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security.\" The RAF describe its mission statement as \"... [to provide] An <i>agile<\/i>, <i>adaptable<\/i> and <i>capable<\/i> Air Force that, person for person, is second to none, and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission.\" The mission statement is supported by the RAF's definition of air power, which guides its strategy. Air power is defined as: \"The ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events.\"<\/p>\n<p>Today the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft, described by the RAF as being \"leading-edge\" in terms of technology. This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft, including: fighter and strike aircraft, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft, aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft. The majority of the RAF's rotary aircraft form part of the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command in support of ground forces. Most of the RAF's aircraft and personnel are based in the UK, with many others serving on operations (principally Afghanistan) or at long-established overseas bases (Ascension Island, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands). Although the RAF is the principal British air power arm, the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and the British Army's Army Air Corps also deliver air power which is integrated into the maritime, littoral and land environments.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":2,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/rO","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2680\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/royal-air-force\/","livevideo":"","category":"Organization","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2680","active":true,"slug":"royal-air-force","links":"","id":2680,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:10:44.553521","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/d\/da\/RAF_logo.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Air_Force\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Royal Air Force","item_count":98},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-08-27T18:35:34.287686","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43355","local_url":"\/topic\/tupolev-tu-95\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tupolev_Tu-95","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Tupolev Tu-95<\/b> (Russian: Туполев Ту-95; NATO reporting name: \"<b>Bear<\/b>\") is a large, four-engine turboprop-powered strategic bomber and missile platform.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":8,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","active":true,"slug":"entertainment","links":"","id":75,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"entertainment","item_count":8463},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-05-20T04:40:16.582929","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=66484","local_url":"\/topic\/travel\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travel","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

The capital, Baghdad, is in the center of the country. Around 97% of the country's 36,000,000 people are Muslims, mainly Shias, Sunnis, and ethnic Kurds.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf and its territory encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through the center of Iraq and flow into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. Theses rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.<\/p>\n<p>The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as Mesopotamia and thought to be the birthplace of writing and the world's oldest civilizations. The area has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of Sèvres. Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States of America and its allies, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held. The American presence in Iraq ended in 2011 but the Iraqi insurgency continued and intensified as fighters from the Syrian Civil War spilled into the country.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EU","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/268\/","latitude":33.2405,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/iraq\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=268","active":true,"slug":"iraq","links":"","id":268,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f6\/Flag_of_Iraq.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iraq\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Iraq","item_count":2337},{"longitude":43.7817,"created_on":"2012-04-01T16:09:10","placetype":"Colloquial","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=29421","local_url":"\/topic\/iraqi-kurdistan-iq\/","geohash":"syr1s72c7d18","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iraqi_Kurdistan","woeid":55966889,"description":"<p><b>Iraqi Kurdistan<\/b> or <b>Southern Kurdistan<\/b> (Kurdish: باشووری کوردستان \/ <i>Başûrê Kurdistanê<\/i>), also known as the <b>Kurdistan Region<\/b> (Kurdish: هه‌رێمی کوردستان \/ <i>Herêmî Kurdistan<\/i>) is an autonomous region in Northern Iraq. It borders the Kurdish regions of Iran to the east, Turkey to the north, and Syria to the west, along with the rest of Iraq to the south. The regional capital is Erbil, known in Kurdish as <i>Hewlêr<\/i>. The region is officially governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government.<\/p>\n<p>Iraqi Kurdistan is a parliamentary democracy with a regional assembly that consists of 111 seats. The current president is Masoud Barzani, who was initially elected in 2005 and re-elected in 2009. The new Iraqi constitution defines Iraqi Kurdistan as a federal entity of Iraq, and establishes Arabic and Kurdish as Iraq's joint official languages. The four governorates of Duhok, Hawler, Silemani, and Halabja comprise around 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi) and have a population of 8.35 million (2013 estimate). In 2014, during the 2014 Iraq Crisis, Iraqi Kurdistan's forces also took over much of the disputed territories of Northern Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>The establishment of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq dates back to the March 1970 autonomy agreement between the Kurdish opposition and the Iraqi government after years of heavy fighting. The agreement however failed to be implemented and by 1974 Northern Iraq plunged into another round of bloody conflict between the Kurds and the Arab-dominated government of Iraq. Further, the 1980-8 Iran–Iraq War and especially the Anfal genocide campaign of the Iraqi army devastated the population and nature of Iraqi Kurdistan. Following the 1991 uprising of Kurds in the north and Shia's in the south against Saddam Hussein, the Peshmerga succeeded in pushing out the main Iraqi forces from the north. Despite significant casualties and the crisis of refugees in bordering regions of Iran and Turkey, the Peshmerga success and establishment of the northern no-fly zone following the First Gulf War in 1991, created the basis for Kurdish self-rule and facilitation of return of Kurdish refugees. As Kurds continued to fight government troops, Iraqi forces finally left Kurdistan in October 1991, leaving the region with <i>de facto<\/i> autonomy. In 1992, Kurdish major political movements of KDP and PUK established the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government. The 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent political changes led to the ratification of a new Constitution of Iraq in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2014, Iraqi Kurdistan is in dispute with the Federal Iraqi government, on the issues of territorial control, export of oil and budget distribution and is functioning largely outside Baghdad's control. With the escalation of the Iraqi Crisis and fears of Iraq's collapse, Kurds have increasingly debated the issue of independence. In June 2014, the Kurdish President announced plans to hold an official independence referendum \"within several months\".<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hoh","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/29421\/","latitude":35.438,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/iraqi-kurdistan-iq\/","livevideo":"","category":"Colloquial","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=29421","active":true,"slug":"iraqi-kurdistan-iq","links":"","id":29421,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:45:18.582342","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/35\/Flag_of_Kurdistan.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iraqi_Kurdistan\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Iraqi Kurdistan, IQ","item_count":93},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.

Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria.

The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests.

A World Health Organization report released April 30, 2014 states, \"this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability, and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile, and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second- and even third-line antibiotics is, thus, sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> in some nosocomial settings. Some pathogens, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i>, also possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.<\/p>\r\n<p>It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the acquisition of resistance genes from other bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer via conjugation, transduction, or transformation. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids, facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>, the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis, since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. Also <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i> lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.<\/p>\r\n<p>Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and veterinary medicine. Any use of antibiotics can increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies, there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs. Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection; of these, MRSA is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus<\/i>), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus<\/i>), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus<\/i>) and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii<\/i>) are prominent examples.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" Although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value and because of the problem created by use of the word \"complete,\" it remains the most enduring. Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.

A World Health Organization report released April 30, 2014 states, \"this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability, and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile, and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second- and even third-line antibiotics is, thus, sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> in some nosocomial settings. Some pathogens, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i>, also possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.<\/p>\r\n<p>It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the acquisition of resistance genes from other bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer via conjugation, transduction, or transformation. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids, facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>, the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis, since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. Also <i>M. tuberculosis<\/i> lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.<\/p>\r\n<p>Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and veterinary medicine. Any use of antibiotics can increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies, there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs. Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection; of these, MRSA is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus<\/i>), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus<\/i>), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus<\/i>) and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant <i>A. baumannii<\/i>) are prominent examples. Nosocomial infections overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly common in the community.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/HAD","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/26911\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/superbug\/","livevideo":"","category":"MedicalCondition","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=26911","active":true,"slug":"superbug","links":"","id":26911,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T00:34:22.571020","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/20\/Antibiotic_sensitvity_and_resistance.JPG","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antibiotic_resistance\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"superbugs","item_count":16},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-05-01T14:36:15","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=67","local_url":"\/topic\/health\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Health","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Health<\/b> is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism.

Together they own about 14 percent of its shares but control 56 of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" and its unofficial slogan was \"Don't be evil.\" In 2004, Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine. It offers online productivity software including email (Gmail), a cloud storage service (Google Drive), an office suite (Google Docs) and a social networking service (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos, and instant messaging. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a netbook known as a Chromebook. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its \"high-quality low-cost\" Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012. In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.<\/p>\n<p>The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world (as of 2007) and to process over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009).

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","active":true,"slug":"tech","links":"","id":25,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"tech","item_count":8413}],"url_domain":"yahoo.com","content":"Google is set to launch a subscription model for YouTube in a few months, executive tells CNBC - @Reuters","slug":"google-is-set-to-launch-a-subscription-model-for-y","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKdX","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/516917\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/18\/google-is-set-to-launch-a-subscription-model-for-y","author":{"full_name":"Tom Brew","id":7,"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Tom"},"note":null,"media":null,"type":"text","id":516917,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":48},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bloom.bg\/1AKKBJc","date":"2015-02-19T14:02:19.738367","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/557649475158552576\/DGNVsWI-_normal.png","screen_name":"markets","date":"2015-02-19T13:53:19","resource_uri":"","content":"Walmart is giving 500,000 workers a raise. http:\/\/t.co\/YkC39CwfpL","id":309411,"tweet_id":"568407987531997184","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markets\/status\/568407987531997184","user_id":"69620713","name":"Bloomberg Markets ","location":"New York"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 02:02 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T14:02:22.462962","url":"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-02-19\/walmart-just-announced-that-it-s-giving-500-000-workers-a-raise","source":null,"push_content":"Wal-Mart announces plan to boost wages for 500,000 workers; sets $9 minimum entry-level hourly rate - @markets","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/wal-mart-announces-plan-to-boost-wages-for-500000","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","local_url":"\/topic\/earnings\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Earnings","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Earnings<\/b> are the net benefits of a corporation's operation.

Headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, the company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962 and incorporated on October 31, 1969. It has over 11,000 stores in 27 countries, under a total 55 different names. The company operates under the Walmart name in the US and Puerto Rico. It operates in Mexico as Walmart de México y Centroamérica, in the United Kingdom as Asda, in Japan as Seiyu, and in India as Best Price. It has wholly owned operations in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada.<\/p>\n<p>The company is the world's largest public corporation, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in 2014, the biggest private employer in the world with over two million employees, and the largest retailer in the world. Walmart is a family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family, who own over 50 percent of Walmart through their holding company, Walton Enterprises. It is also one of the world's most valuable companies (in terms of market value), and is also the largest grocery retailer in the US. In 2009, it generated 51 percent of its US$258 billion (equivalent to $284 billion in 2014) sales in the US from grocery business. It also owns and operates the Sam's Club retail warehouses in North America.<\/p>\n<p>The company was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company rose from a regional to national giant. By 1988, Walmart was the most profitable retailer in the US and by October 1989 it had become the largest in terms of revenue. Geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest up to the mid 1980s, by the early 1990s the chain's presence spanned coast to coast - Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989 and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster on July 28, 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania was opened in October 1990 bringing the main store into the Northeast. Walmart's investments outside North America have had mixed results: its operations in the United Kingdom, South America, and China are highly successful, whereas ventures in Germany and South Korea were unsuccessful.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":2,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ch","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/157\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/wal-mart\/","livevideo":"","category":"Company","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=157","active":true,"slug":"wal-mart","links":"","id":157,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T14:03:16.381447","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8c\/Walton%27s_Five_and_Dime_store%2C_Bentonville%2C_Arkansas.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Walmart\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Wal-Mart","item_count":284},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","woeid":null,"description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b>, also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","active":true,"slug":"tech","links":"","id":25,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"tech","item_count":8413},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-05-20T04:40:16.582929","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=66484","local_url":"\/topic\/travel\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travel","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":8,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/barack-obama\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5","active":true,"slug":"barack-obama","links":"","id":5,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T17:09:24.855890","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8d\/President_Barack_Obama.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Barack Obama","item_count":9167},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences, that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish.<\/p>\r\n<p>Films recorded in analog form traditionally included an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.<\/p>\r\n<p>Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence and its sexist treatment of women.<\/p>\r\n<p>The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection of traditional films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called phi phenomenon.<\/p>\r\n<p>The name \"film\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including <i>picture<\/i>, <i>picture show<\/i>, <i>moving picture<\/i>, <i>photoplay<\/i> and <i>flick<\/i>. The most common term in the United States is <i>movie<\/i>, while in Europe <i>film<\/i> is preferred. Terms for the field in general include <i>the big screen<\/i>, <i>the silver screen<\/i>, <i>the movies<\/i> and <i>cinema<\/i>; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word <i>sheet<\/i> was sometimes used instead of <i>screen<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"primary":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bb","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/89\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/film\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=89","active":true,"slug":"film","links":"","id":89,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T00:42:09.701378","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c4\/Fox_movietone_2.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"film","item_count":1319},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-05-13T12:53:46.903204","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=65890","local_url":"\/topic\/alien-film\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alien_(film)","woeid":null,"description":"<p><i><b>Alien<\/b><\/i> is a 1979 science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. Dan O'Bannon wrote the screenplay from a story he wrote with Ronald Shusett, drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill through their Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill made revisions and additions to the script. Shusett was executive producer. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the human aspects of the film.<\/p>\r\n<p><i>Alien<\/i> received both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright, and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other award nominations.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":8,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","active":true,"slug":"entertainment","links":"","id":75,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:05:54.316583","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"entertainment","item_count":8463}],"url_domain":"variety.com","content":"Director Neill Blomkamp to develop new 'Alien' movie - @variety","slug":"director-neill-blomkamp-to-direct-new-alien-movi","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKdw","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/516942\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/director-neill-blomkamp-to-direct-new-alien-movi","author":{"full_name":"Stephanie Clary","id":8,"email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","last_name":"Clary","username":"stephanie.clary","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Stephanie"},"note":null,"media":null,"type":"text","id":516942,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":43},{"shortened_url":null,"date":"2015-02-18T23:35:07.670868","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Feb 18, 2015, 11:35 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-18T23:35:11.045733","url":"","source":null,"push_content":"US State Department responds to Iraqi UN Ambassador Alhakim's claim that Islamic State is harvesting organs; says not in position to confirm comments but have no reason to doubt them - @NBCNews","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/18\/us-state-department-responds-to-iraqi-un-ambassado","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-09-10T17:26:28.414932","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=82188","local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-threat-in-iraq-syria\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"<p>Sunni militants led by the Islamic State declared a caliphate that stretches across eastern Syria and much of northern and western Iraq.

The capital, Baghdad, is in the center of the country. Around 97% of the country's 36,000,000 people are Muslims, mainly Shias, Sunnis, and ethnic Kurds.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq has a narrow section of coastline measuring 58 km (36 mi) on the northern Persian Gulf and its territory encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain, the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range, and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through the center of Iraq and flow into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf. Theses rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land.<\/p>\n<p>The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is often referred to as Mesopotamia and thought to be the birthplace of writing and the world's oldest civilizations. The area has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. At different periods in its history, Iraq was the center of the indigenous Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian empires. It was also part of the Median, Achaemenid, Hellenistic, Parthian, Sassanid, Roman, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Mongol, Safavid, Afsharid, and Ottoman empires, and under British control as a League of Nations mandate.<\/p>\n<p>Iraq's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of Sèvres. Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States of America and its allies, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held. The American presence in Iraq ended in 2011 but the Iraqi insurgency continued and intensified as fighters from the Syrian Civil War spilled into the country.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EU","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/268\/","latitude":33.2405,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/iraq\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=268","active":true,"slug":"iraq","links":"","id":268,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f6\/Flag_of_Iraq.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iraq\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Iraq","item_count":2337},{"longitude":-95.845,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","placetype":"Country","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","woeid":23424977,"description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b> or <b>U.S.A.<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>US<\/b> or <b>U.S.<\/b>), <b>America<\/b>, and sometimes <b>the States<\/b>, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","latitude":37.1679,"recent_count":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","active":true,"slug":"united-states","links":"","id":10,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"United States","item_count":15934},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-01-04T16:58:42.108388","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52847","local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Islamic State<\/b> (<b>IS<\/b>) (Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ <i>ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah<\/i>), formerly the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant<\/b> (داعش) (<b>ISIL<\/b> \/ˈaɪsəl\/) or the <b>Islamic State of Iraq and Syria<\/b> (<b>ISIS<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪs\/), is a Sunni jihadist group in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group. The United Nations has accused the Islamic State of committing \"mass atrocities\" and war crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS is the successor to <b>Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn<\/b>—more commonly known as <b>Al-Qaeda in Iraq<\/b> (<b>AQI<\/b>)—formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004, which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003–2011 Iraq War, it combined with other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council and consolidated further into the <b>Islamic State of Iraq<\/b> (<b>ISI<\/b> \/ˈaɪsɪ\/). At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the Islamic State of Iraq's violent attempts to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups, which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a decline in the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014, when after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Under its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has grown significantly, gaining support in Iraq due to alleged economic and political discrimination against Arab Iraqi Sunnis, and establishing a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo after entering the Syrian Civil War.<\/p>\r\n<p>In June 2014, ISIS had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the group had increased its strength to 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq.<\/p>\r\n<p>ISIS’s original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq. Following its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi—now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim—was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":9,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NuX","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52847\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant\/","livevideo":"","category":"Organization","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52847","active":true,"slug":"islamic-state-of-iraq-and-the-levant","links":"","id":52847,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T20:55:37.960914","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/58\/Flag_of_the_Islamic_State.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant","item_count":1761},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-18T23:34:49.724141","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=259077","local_url":"\/topic\/mohamed-ali-alhakim\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFYp","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/259077\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mohamed-ali-alhakim\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=259077","active":true,"slug":"mohamed-ali-alhakim","links":"","id":259077,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-18T23:35:07.670868","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Muhammad Ali Alhakim","item_count":1},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2010-05-18T15:45:21","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=54","local_url":"\/topic\/united-nations\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Nations","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>United Nations<\/b> (<b>UN<\/b>) is an intergovernmental organization established on 24 October 1945 to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was created following the Second World War to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The UN Headquarters is situated in Manhattan, New York City and enjoys extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.<\/p>\n<p>During the Second World War, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated talks on a successor agency to the League of Nations, and the United Nations Charter was drafted at a conference in April–June 1945; this charter took effect on 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.<\/p>\n<p>The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) (for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the United Nations Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by South Korean Ban Ki-moon since 2007. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work.<\/p>\n<p>The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, corrupt, or biased.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/2","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/54\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-nations\/","livevideo":"","category":"Organization","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=54","active":true,"slug":"united-nations","links":"","id":54,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T14:56:00.269142","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2f\/Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Nations\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"United Nations","item_count":3277},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2010-05-19T15:49:34","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=475","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and borders the U.S. states of New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, and Louisiana to the east. Texas has an area of 268,820 square miles (696,200 km<sup>2<\/sup>) and a growing population of over 26.4 million residents (July 2013).<\/p>\n<p>Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the United States, while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest United States metropolitan areas, respectively. Other major cities include El Paso and Austin—the state capital. Texas is nicknamed the <i>Lone Star State<\/i> to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The \"Lone Star\" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today. The origin of the state name, Texas, is from the word, \"Tejas\", which means 'friends' in the Caddo language.<\/p>\n<p>Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest. Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts, less than 10 percent of the land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The term \"six flags over Texas\", as can be seen in the Grand Prairie-based large national and international amusement park operator <i>Six Flags<\/i>, came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony in Texas. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic. In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican–American War in 1846. A slave state, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the \"Confederate States of America\" on March 2 of the same year. After the consequent Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.<\/p>\n<p>One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle. Due to its long history as a center of the industry, Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy. The state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century, when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PJ","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/939\/","latitude":31.1689,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/texas-us\/","livevideo":"","category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=939","active":true,"slug":"texas-us","links":"","id":939,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Flag_of_Texas.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Texas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Texas, US","item_count":1731},{"longitude":-97.7716,"created_on":"2012-08-20T18:12:40","placetype":"County","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=22667","local_url":"\/topic\/travis-tx-us\/","geohash":"9v6kx0susdg5","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travis_County,_Texas","woeid":12590233,"description":"<p><b>Travis County<\/b> is a county located in south central Texas.

Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is sometimes referred to as <b>marriage equality<\/b> or <b>equal marriage<\/b>, particularly by supporters. The legalization of same-sex marriage is characterized as \"redefining marriage\" by many opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. As of 28 June 2014, sixteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, Uruguay) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of Mexico and the United States) allow same-sex couples to marry. The law in Luxembourg will come into force on 1 January 2015. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via a ballot initiative or a referendum). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, human rights and civil rights issue, as well as a religious issue in many nations and around the world, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, or instead be allowed to hold a different status (a civil union), or be denied such rights. Same-sex marriage can provide same-sex couples who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of opposite-sex married couples. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex couples benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions. Court documents filed by American scientific associations also state that singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them. The American Anthropological Association avers that social science research does not support the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon not recognizing same-sex marriage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting. Various faith communities around the world support allowing same-sex couples to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: Buddhism in Australia, Church of Sweden, Conservative Judaism, U.S. Episcopalians, Humanistic Judaism, Native American religions with a two-spirit tradition, Druids, the Metropolitan Community Church, Quakers, Reconstructionist Judaism, Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalists, the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, and Wiccans, as well as various other progressive and modern Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish groups and various minor religions and other denominations.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B1","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/115\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/same-sex-marriage\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=115","active":true,"slug":"same-sex-marriage","links":"","id":115,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ed\/Major_Alan_G._Roger_at_Same-Sex_Wedding_Ceremony.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Same-sex_marriage\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"same-sex marriage","item_count":983},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","woeid":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest, along with the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. The province's name was chosen by Queen Victoria in 1858, reflecting its origins as the British remainder of the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1871, it became the sixth province of Canada. Its Latin motto is <i>Splendor sine occasu<\/i> (\"Splendour without Diminishment\").<\/p>\n<p>The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada, named for the Queen who created the Colony of British Columbia. The largest city is Vancouver, the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada, the largest in Western Canada, and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest. In October 2013, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 (about 2.5 million of whom were in Greater Vancouver). The province is currently governed by the BC Liberal Party, led by Premier Christy Clark, who became leader as a result of a leadership convention vote on February 26, 2011, and who led her party to an election victory on May 14, 2013.<\/p>\n<p>British Columbia's economy is largely resource-based. It is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major Pacific ports that enable international trade. Though less than 5% of its vast 944,735 km<sup>2<\/sup> (364,764 sq mi) land is arable, the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the Fraser and Okanagan valleys) because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys. Its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism, though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction, principally logging, farming, and mining. Vancouver, the province's largest city and metropolitan area, also serves as the headquarters of many of the western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average.

A former system administrator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a counterintelligence trainer at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he later worked for the private intelligence contractor Dell inside an NSA outpost in Japan. In March 2013, he joined the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton inside the NSA center in Hawaii. In June 2013, he came to international attention after disclosing to several media outlets thousands of classified documents that he acquired while working as an NSA contractor for Dell and Booz Allen Hamilton. Snowden's leaked documents revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many of them run by the NSA and the Five Eyes with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy. Two court rulings since the initial leaks have split on the constitutionality of the NSA's bulk collection of telephone metadata.<\/p>\n<p>On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew from Hawaii to Hong Kong, where in early June he revealed numerous classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, both of whom he had summoned to Hong Kong for that purpose. On June 9, four days after the press first exposed a secret NSA program based on his leaks, Snowden made his identity public. On June 14 the U.S. Department of Justice charged him with two counts of violating the Espionage Act and theft of government property, punishable by up to 30 years in prison. The U.S. Department of State revoked his passport on June 22. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Snowden met with Russian diplomats while in Hong Kong. On June 23, Snowden—who later said he had been ticketed for onward travel via Havana, Cuba—flew to Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. ABC News reported that Snowden \"could not enter Russia because he did not have a Russian visa and he could not travel to safe haven opportunities in Latin America because the United States had canceled his passport.\" Snowden remained in the airport transit zone for 39 days, during which time he applied for asylum in 21 countries. On August 1, 2013, Russian authorities granted him a one-year temporary asylum. A year later, Russia issued Snowden a three-year residency permit allowing him to travel freely within the country and to go abroad for not longer than three months.

When something is private to a <i>person<\/i>, it usually means there is something to them inherently special or sensitive. The domain of privacy partially overlaps security, including for instance the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.<\/p>\n<p>The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government, corporations or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning taxation, which normally require the sharing of information about personal income or earnings. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy may be voluntarily sacrificed, normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships.

However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":12,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","active":true,"slug":"tech","links":"","id":25,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:20:18.503880","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"tech","item_count":8413}],"url_domain":"firstlook.org","content":"Report: US, British spies stole encryption keys from largest manufacturer of SIM cards in the world, new documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden show - @the_intercept","slug":"report-us-british-spies-stole-encryption-keys-fr","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKkg","importance":4,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517360\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/report-us-british-spies-stole-encryption-keys-fr","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":null,"type":"text","id":517360,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":36},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/1Lc3AvH","date":"2015-02-18T21:47:52.028871","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Feb 18, 2015, 09:47 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-18T21:47:54.090583","url":"http:\/\/www.trust.org\/item\/20150218214456-asud8","source":null,"push_content":"At least 36 killed as military plane bombs a funeral party in a Niger village; official blames Nigeria - @Reuters","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/18\/at-least-36-killed-as-military-plane-bombs-a-funer","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-02-24T20:47:15","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=526","local_url":"\/topic\/nigeria-sect-attacks\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nigeria_sect_attacks","woeid":null,"description":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5icOaICJSf4PHbRyzPfmhHMHln2Vw?docId=5314b56f39354a5ba23611adc7793c8c\">AP<\/a>: A radical Muslim sect known locally as Boko Haram has been claiming responsibility for a series of attacks that can be traced back to early November 2011.

It borders Nigeria and Benin to the south, Burkina Faso and Mali to the west, Algeria and Libya to the north and Chad to the east. Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000 km<sup>2<\/sup>, making it the largest nation in West Africa, with over 80 percent of its land area covered by the Sahara desert. The country's predominantly Islamic population of 17,138,707 is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the nation. The capital city is Niamey, located in the far-southwest corner of Niger.<\/p>\n<p>Niger is a developing country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked last at 187th for 2013. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position, desert terrain, poor education and poverty of its people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental degradation.<\/p>\n<p>Nigerien (\/niːˈʒɛəriən\/) society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state. Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule. Following a military coup in 2010, Niger has become a democratic, multi-party state.

Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p>\n<p>The site of many ancient kingdoms and empires, the modern political state of Nigeria has its origins in the British colonization of the region during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries; it emerged from the combination of two neighboring British protectorates: the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate. During the colonial period, the British set up administrative and legal structures whilst retaining traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960, but plunged into civil war several years later. It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships, with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably freely and fairly.<\/p>\n<p>Nigeria is often referred to as the \"Giant of Africa\", due to its large population and economy. With approximately 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. The country is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. Regarding religion, Nigeria is roughly divided in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern and central parts of the country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the northern and southwestern regions. A minority of the population practice religions indigenous to Nigeria, such as those native to Igbo and Yoruba peoples.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Nigeria's economy (GDP) became the largest in Africa, worth more than $500 billion, and overtook South Africa to become the world's 26th largest economy. Furthermore, the debt-to-GDP ratio is only 11 percent (8 percent below the 2012 ratio). By 2050, Nigeria is expected to become one of the world's top 20 economies. The country's oil reserves have played a major role in its growing wealth and influence. Nigeria is considered to be an Emerging market by the World Bank and has been identified as a regional power in Africa. It is also a member of the MINT group of countries, which are widely seen as the globe's next \"BRIC-like\" economies. It is also listed among the \"Next Eleven\" economies set to become among the biggest in the world. Nigeria is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the African Union, OPEC, and the United Nations among other international organizations.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FG","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/316\/","latitude":9.08457,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/nigeria\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=316","active":true,"slug":"nigeria","links":"","id":316,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-18T21:47:52.028871","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/79\/Flag_of_Nigeria.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nigeria\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Nigeria","item_count":1118},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong).

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences.

Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","id":4448,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":52,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":11,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","active":true,"slug":"weather","links":"","id":121,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"weather","item_count":27530}],"url_domain":"news.com.au","content":"Hundreds of families evacuate Australia's coasts as Cyclone Marcia approaches Queensland and Cyclone Lam moves toward country's Top End - @newscomauHQ","slug":"hundreds-of-families-evacuate-australias-coasts-a","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKe1","importance":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517009\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/hundreds-of-families-evacuate-australias-coasts-a","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":488,"id":65452,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Lp1XOIcAAFxuB.jpg:thumb","width":650,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/newscomauHQ","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Lp1XOIcAAFxuB.jpg","author_name":"news.com.au","original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/newscomauHQ\/status\/568273606041579520\/photo\/1","title":"Trees torn out by roots and families evacuated as #CycloneLam and #CycloneMarcia approach http:\/\/t.co\/g5Ku9R7xTw http:\/\/t.co\/wQbXy7pvZM","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":517009,"pushed":true,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":57},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/17uFK11","date":"2015-02-19T13:10:53.380075","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1463293955\/aleqtlogot_22_normal.jpg","screen_name":"aleqtisadiah","date":"2015-02-19T12:53:46","resource_uri":"","content":"اصطدام سيارة بطائرة في مطار جدة http:\/\/t.co\/3qA5BjhBuk http:\/\/t.co\/ETaSCCQXhU","id":309527,"tweet_id":"568393002864881665","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aleqtisadiah\/status\/568393002864881665","user_id":"67277253","name":"صحيفة الاقتصادية ","location":"riyadh"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 01:10 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T17:08:07.855182","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aleqtisadiah\/status\/568393002864881665\/photo\/1","source":null,"push_content":"Photo: Car crushed Saudi Arabian jet at Jeddah Airport in Saudi Arabia - @aleqtisadiah","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-car-crushed-saudi-arabian-jet-at-jeddah-air","topics":[{"longitude":39.1829,"created_on":"2012-02-26T14:28:19","placetype":"Town","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=19041","local_url":"\/topic\/jeddah-makkah-sa\/","geohash":"sggf5ws5gxpg","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeddah","woeid":1939873,"description":"<p><b>Jeddah<\/b> (sometimes spelled <i>Jiddah<\/i> or <i>Jedda <\/i>; <small>English<\/small> <small>pronunciation:<\/small> \/ˈdʒɛdə\/; Arabic: جدة‎ <i>Jiddah<\/i> or <i>Jaddah<\/i>, <small>IPA: <\/small>[ˈdʒɪdæ, ˈdʒædæ]) is a city in the Hijaz Tihamah region on the coast of the Red Sea and is the major urban center of western Saudi Arabia.

Peter I Island is a dependent territory and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Norway has a total area of 385,252 square kilometres (148,747 sq mi) and a population of 5,109,059 people (2014). The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long). Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak Strait to the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea.<\/p>\n<p>King Harald V of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg is the current monarch of Norway. Erna Solberg became Prime Minister in 2013, replacing Jens Stoltenberg. A constitutional monarchy since 1814, state power is divided between the Parliament, the King and his Council, and the Supreme Court. Between 1661 and 1814, Norway was an absolute monarchy, and before 1661, the King shared power with the Norwegian nobility. Traditionally established in 872 and originating in one of the petty kingdoms, Norway is one of the oldest still existing kingdoms in Europe and world-wide. The Kingdom has existed continuously for over 1,100 years, and the list of Norwegian monarchs includes over sixty kings and earls.<\/p>\n<p>Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels, known as counties (fylke) and municipalities (kommune). The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and the Finnmark Act. Norway maintains close ties with the European Union and its member countries (despite rejecting full EU membership in two referenda), as well as with the United States. Norway is a founding member of the United Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe, and the Nordic Council; a member of the European Economic Area, the WTO and the OECD; and is also a part of the Schengen Area.<\/p>\n<p>The country maintains a combination of market economy and a Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system. Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum, natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, fresh water, and hydropower. The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. The country has the fourth-highest per capita income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists, as well as ninth-highest on a more comprehensive CIA list. On a per-capita basis, it is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the Middle East, From 2001 to 2006, and then again from 2009 to 2014, Norway had the highest Human Development Index ranking in the world. Norway has also topped the Legatum Prosperity Index for the last five years. The OECD ranks Norway fourth in the 2013 equalised Better Life Index and third in intergenerational earnings elasticity. From 2010 to 2012, Norway was classified as the most democratic country by the Democracy Index.<\/p>\n<p>Two centuries of Viking raids to southern and western areas of Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity especially since AD 994. Norway expanded its control overseas to parts of Britain, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland, and Norwegian power peaked in 1265. Competition from the Hanseatic League and the spread of the Black Death weakened the country, and when the native royal house became extinct in the 1300s, Norway was gradually absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians adopted a constitution before being forced into a personal union with Sweden. In 1905, Norway ended the union, subsequently confirmed in a referendum, and thus over 500 years with monarchs residing outside the country. In the same year, the country confirmed the election of its own king. Despite its declaration of neutrality in World War II, Norway was occupied for 5 years by forces of Nazi Germany. In 1949 it abandoned neutrality, becoming a founding member of NATO. Discovery of oil in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sR","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2745\/","latitude":64.5565,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/norway\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2745","active":true,"slug":"norway","links":"","id":2745,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T01:29:00.874212","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d9\/Flag_of_Norway.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Norway\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Norway","item_count":324},{"longitude":-3.99667,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:41","placetype":"State","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=232","local_url":"\/topic\/scotland-gb\/","geohash":"gfj4m13enf4b","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scotland","woeid":12578048,"description":"<p><b>Scotland<\/b> (\/ˈskɒt.lənd\/; <small><big>Scots:<\/big> <\/small>[ˈskɔt.lənd]; Scottish Gaelic: <i>Alba<\/i> [ˈal̪ˠapə]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. Occupying the northern third of the island of Great Britain, Scotland shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean; with the North Sea to the east, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.<\/p>\n<p>Edinburgh, the country's capital and second-largest city, was the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century, which transformed Scotland into one of the commercial, intellectual, and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, was once one of the world's leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Scottish waters consist of a large sector of the North Atlantic and the North Sea, containing the largest oil reserves in the European Union. This has given Aberdeen, the third-largest city in Scotland, the title of Europe's oil capital.<\/p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. Having entered into a personal union with the kingdoms of England and Ireland following James VI's succession to the English and Irish thrones in 1603, Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create a single Kingdom of Great Britain. This union resulted from the Treaty of Union agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin Acts of Union passed by the Parliaments of both countries, despite popular opposition and anti-union riots in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and elsewhere. Great Britain itself subsequently entered into a political union with Ireland on 1 January 1801 to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>Scotland's legal system has remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in public and private law. The continued existence of legal, educational and religious institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 Union. In 1999, a devolved legislature, the Scottish Parliament, was reconvened with authority over many areas of home affairs following a referendum in 1997. In May 2011, the Scottish National Party won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. As a result, a referendum on independence will take place on 18 September 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Scotland is a member nation of the British–Irish Council, and the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly and also participates within the Common Travel Area agreement.

The country includes the island of Great Britain (a term sometimes also loosely applied to the whole state), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state: the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea in the east and the English Channel in the south; the Irish Sea separates Great Britain from Ireland. The UK has an area of 243,610 square kilometres (94,060 sq mi), making it the 78th largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th largest in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is the 22nd most populous country, with an estimated 64.1 million inhabitants. It is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of governance. Its capital city is London, an important global city and financial centre with the second-largest urban area in the European Union. The current British monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. The United Kingdom has fourteen Overseas Territories, including the disputed Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 1536. In 1707, the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in 1801, united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. British Overseas Territories, formerly colonies, are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks from fourth to sixth (depending on the source) in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor the European Economic Community (EEC) since 1973; it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"primary":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","latitude":54.3141,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","active":true,"slug":"united-kingdom","links":"","id":30,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:10:44.553521","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Scotland%29.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"United Kingdom","item_count":7328},{"longitude":108.831,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:27","placetype":"Country","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87","local_url":"\/topic\/russia\/","geohash":"y6t6hx0r6pe7","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia","woeid":23424936,"description":"<p><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Russia<\/b> \/ˈrʌʃə\/ or \/ˈrʊʃə\/ (Russian: Россия, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossiya<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small>[rɐˈsʲijə]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially known as the <b>Russian Federation<\/b> (Russian: Российская Федерация, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossiyskaya Federatsiya<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small>[rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈrat͡sɨjə]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), is a country in northern Eurasia. It is a federal semi-presidential republic. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk, the US state of Alaska across the Bering Strait and Canada's Arctic islands. At 17,075,400 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the world's ninth most populous nation with 143 million people as of 2012. Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans nine time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North America.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a recognized superpower, which played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite, and the first man in space. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality of the Union state.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the ninth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2014. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources, the largest reserves in the world, have made it one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":10,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BZ","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87\/","latitude":59.4538,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russia\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87","active":true,"slug":"russia","links":"","id":87,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T16:25:03.424108","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/f\/f3\/Flag_of_Russia.svg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Russia","item_count":5835},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-09-09T20:43:11.606252","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=44229","local_url":"\/topic\/eurofighter-typhoon\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eurofighter_Typhoon","woeid":null,"description":"<dl><dd><i>\"EF2000\" redirects here.

The Typhoon was designed and is manufactured by a consortium of three companies; BAE Systems, Airbus Group and Alenia Aermacchi, who conduct the majority of affairs dealing with the project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, which was formed in 1986. The project is managed by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, which also acts as the prime customer.<\/p>\n<p>Development of the aircraft effectively began in 1983 with the <i>Future European Fighter Aircraft<\/i> programme, a multinational collaborative effort between the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Due to disagreements over design authority and operational requirements, France left the consortium to independently develop the Dassault Rafale instead. A technology demonstration aircraft, the British Aerospace EAP, first took flight on 6 August 1986; the first prototype of the finalised Eurofighter made its first flight on 27 March 1994. The name of the aircraft, Typhoon, was formally adopted in September 1998; the first production contracts were signed that same year.<\/p>\n<p>Political issues in the partner nations significantly protracted the Typhoon's development; the sudden end of the Cold War reduced European demand for fighter aircraft, and there was debate over the cost and work share of the Eurofighter. The Typhoon was introduced into operational service in 2003. Currently, the type has entered service with the Austrian Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the German Air Force, the Royal Air Force, the Spanish Air Force, and the Royal Saudi Air Force. The Royal Air Force of Oman has also been confirmed as an export customer, bringing the procurement total to 571 aircraft as of 2013.<\/p>\n<p>The Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed to be an effective dogfighter when in combat with other aircraft; later production aircraft have been increasingly more well-equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment. The Typhoon saw its combat debut during the 2011 military intervention in Libya with the Royal Air Force and the Italian Air Force, performing reconnaissance and ground strike missions. The type has also taken primary responsibility for air defence duties for the majority of customer nations.<\/p>","daily_count":2,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LfX","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/44229\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/eurofighter-typhoon\/","livevideo":"","category":"Vehicle","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=44229","active":true,"slug":"eurofighter-typhoon","links":"","id":44229,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T10:10:44.553521","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/64\/RSAF_Typhoon_at_Malta_-_Gordon_Zammit.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eurofighter_Typhoon\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Eurofighter Typhoon","item_count":7},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-03-21T17:05:13","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2680","local_url":"\/topic\/royal-air-force\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Air_Force","woeid":null,"description":"<p>The <b>Royal Air Force<\/b> (<b>RAF<\/b>) is the aerial warfare service branch of the British Armed Forces.

Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged – at the time – the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.<\/p>\n<p>The RAF's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence (MoD), which are to \"provide the capabilities needed: to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories, including against terrorism; to support the Government’s foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security.\" The RAF describe its mission statement as \"...

This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft, including: fighter and strike aircraft, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft, aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft. The majority of the RAF's rotary aircraft form part of the tri-service Joint Helicopter Command in support of ground forces. Most of the RAF's aircraft and personnel are based in the UK, with many others serving on operations (principally Afghanistan) or at long-established overseas bases (Ascension Island, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands).

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":32,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","active":true,"slug":"war-conflict","links":"","id":15,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"war & conflict","item_count":28905}],"url_domain":"youtube.com","content":"Video: Royal Air Force Typhoon jets respond to Russian Tu-95 Bear aircraft - @tvZvezda","slug":"video-royal-air-force-typhoon-jets-respond-to-rus","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKf1","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517071\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/video-royal-air-force-typhoon-jets-respond-to-rus","author":{"full_name":"David Wyllie","id":12,"email":"david.wyllie@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/12\/","last_name":"Wyllie","username":"david.wyllie","is_staff":true,"first_name":"David"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"YouTube","height":480,"id":65460,"html":"<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"\/\/cdn.embedly.com\/widgets\/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FTnZMy1WWjZs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTnZMy1WWjZs&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FTnZMy1WWjZs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=757f4e9454324c109a95ad2768ba5f60&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TnZMy1WWjZs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":640,"thumbnail_height":360,"resource_uri":"","type":"video","thumbnail_width":480,"author_url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/tvZvezda","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TnZMy1WWjZs","author_name":"tvZvezda","original_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TnZMy1WWjZs","title":"Самолеты НАТО окружили российский ракетоносец","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/"},"type":"text","id":517071,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":47},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1EX0WYz","date":"2015-02-19T15:22:40.784910","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/427772096538615808\/Yv6kIPeS_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"KRIS6News","date":"2015-02-19T15:12:38","resource_uri":"","content":"#KRIS6 on scene where 3 CCPD officers have been shot.

Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and borders the U.S. states of New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, and Louisiana to the east. Texas has an area of 268,820 square miles (696,200 km<sup>2<\/sup>) and a growing population of over 26.4 million residents (July 2013).<\/p>\n<p>Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the United States, while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest United States metropolitan areas, respectively. Other major cities include El Paso and Austin—the state capital. Texas is nicknamed the <i>Lone Star State<\/i> to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The \"Lone Star\" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today. The origin of the state name, Texas, is from the word, \"Tejas\", which means 'friends' in the Caddo language.<\/p>\n<p>Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest. Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts, less than 10 percent of the land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The term \"six flags over Texas\", as can be seen in the Grand Prairie-based large national and international amusement park operator <i>Six Flags<\/i>, came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony in Texas. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic. In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican–American War in 1846. A slave state, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the \"Confederate States of America\" on March 2 of the same year. After the consequent Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.<\/p>\n<p>One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle. Due to its long history as a center of the industry, Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy. The state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century, when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PJ","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/939\/","latitude":31.1689,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/texas-us\/","livevideo":"","category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=939","active":true,"slug":"texas-us","links":"","id":939,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Flag_of_Texas.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Texas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Texas, US","item_count":1731},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","woeid":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Situated on the Timor Sea, Darwin is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a population of 136,245. It is the smallest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the Top End's regional centre. Darwin was originally a pioneer outpost.<\/p>\n<p>Darwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it an important Australian gateway to countries such as Indonesia and East Timor. The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin, ending at Port Augusta in South Australia. The city itself is built on a low bluff overlooking the harbour. Its suburbs spread out over some area, beginning at Lee Point in the north and stretching to Berrimah in the east. Past Berrimah, the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin's satellite city, Palmerston, and its suburbs. The region, like the rest of the Top End, has a tropical climate, with a wet and a dry season. The city is noted for its consistently warm to hot climate, all throughout the year. Prone to cyclone activity during the wet season, Darwin experiences heavy monsoonal downpours and spectacular lightning shows. During the dry season, the city is met with blue skies and gentle sea breezes from the picturesque harbour.<\/p>\n<p>The greater Darwin area is the ancestral home of the Larrakia people. On 9 September 1839, HMS <i>Beagle<\/i> sailed into Darwin harbour during its surveying of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region \"Port Darwin\" in honour of their former shipmate Charles Darwin, who had sailed with them on the ship's previous voyage which had ended in October 1836. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, and was renamed Darwin in 1911.

The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","id":4448,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":52,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":11,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","active":true,"slug":"weather","links":"","id":121,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"weather","item_count":27530}],"url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Map: Visualization of winds from Cyclone Lam off Australia's Northern Territory, Cyclone Marcia off Queensland coast - EarthWindMap","slug":"map-visualization-of-winds-from-cyclone-lam-off-a","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKgQ","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517096\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/map-visualization-of-winds-from-cyclone-lam-off-a","author":{"full_name":"David Wyllie","id":12,"email":"david.wyllie@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/12\/","last_name":"Wyllie","username":"david.wyllie","is_staff":true,"first_name":"David"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":688,"id":65464,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-M-kutCcAAgvMG.jpg:thumb","width":890,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/journodave","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-M-kutCcAAgvMG.jpg","author_name":"David Wyllie","original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/journodave\/status\/568366779904499712\/photo\/1","title":"Australia is about to be hit by two cyclones at once. #CycloneLam in the north and #CycloneMarcia off the east coast http:\/\/t.co\/FSPEGxEEfJ","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":517096,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":43},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1MBd0nS","date":"2015-02-19T18:32:37.568614","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000017045313\/4c086389309e56de6fefcf8a0a0e8d43_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"Suntimes","date":"2015-02-19T17:52:32","resource_uri":"","content":"UPDATE: All 7 dogs safe on Near South Side and \"appear to be fine.\" http:\/\/t.co\/O2VEKpAAUr @SPOTNEWSonIG photo http:\/\/t.co\/Vr3oFX6vKT","id":309590,"tweet_id":"568468189698523137","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Suntimes\/status\/568468189698523137","user_id":"12811952","name":"Chicago Sun-Times","location":"Chicago"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 06:32 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T18:32:39.823381","url":"http:\/\/chicago.suntimes.com\/news-chicago\/7\/71\/379030\/dogs-missing-armed-carjackers-take-doggie-daycares-van","source":null,"push_content":"Photo: 7 dogs found safe after armed carjacking of doggie daycare van in Chicago - @Suntimes","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-7-dogs-found-safe-after-armed-carjacking-of","topics":[{"longitude":-87.6324,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:34:52","placetype":"Town","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=174","local_url":"\/topic\/chicago-il-us\/","geohash":"dp3wmbu11hf9","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicago","woeid":2379574,"description":"<p><b>Chicago<\/b> (\/ʃɪˈkɑːɡoʊ\/ or \/ʃɪˈkɔːɡoʊ\/) is the third most populous city in the United States, after New York City and Los Angeles.

To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","id":4448,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":52,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":11,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","active":true,"slug":"weather","links":"","id":121,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"weather","item_count":27530}],"url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Infrared imagery shows Tropical Cyclone Marcia as it approaches Queensland, Australia, as a category 5 storm - @NOAASatellites","slug":"infrared-imagery-shows-tropical-cyclone-marcia-as","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKkE","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517332\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/infrared-imagery-shows-tropical-cyclone-marcia-as","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":812,"id":65529,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-OlhwWIUAASxtR.png:thumb","width":1006,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NOAASatellites","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-OlhwWIUAASxtR.png","author_name":"NOAA Satellites","original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NOAASatellites\/status\/568479977563418624\/photo\/1","title":"VIIRS infrared imagery from @NASANPP of Tropical Cyclone #Marcia as it approaches the eastern coast of Australia. http:\/\/t.co\/6CBhxzuntA","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":517332,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":31},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1vYQVLb","date":"2015-02-19T02:28:31.831743","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/443184781543501825\/y1l929WL_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"azcentral","date":"2015-02-19T02:23:15","resource_uri":"","content":"WATCH LIVE: Hundreds of candles being lit in Prescott at Kayla Mueller memorial http:\/\/t.co\/k9w8Wh3Bn5 http:\/\/t.co\/qxYsukl7kq","id":309545,"tweet_id":"568234325776437248","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/azcentral\/status\/568234325776437248","user_id":"13115682","name":"azcentral","location":"Arizona "},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 02:28 AM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T17:34:53.404712","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/azcentral\/status\/568234325776437248","source":null,"push_content":"Photo: Hundreds of candles let during memorial for Kayla Mueller in Prescott, Ariz. - @azcentral","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-hundreds-of-candles-let-during-memorial-for","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2014-09-10T17:26:28.414932","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=82188","local_url":"\/topic\/islamic-state-threat-in-iraq-syria\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"<p>Sunni militants led by the Islamic State declared a caliphate that stretches across eastern Syria and much of northern and western Iraq.

ISIL published a photo of a damaged building and alleged that she had been held there, but no proof of death was provided.<\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nGc","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/150316\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/kayla-mueller\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=150316","active":true,"slug":"kayla-mueller","links":"","id":150316,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T02:28:31.831743","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Kayla Mueller","item_count":19},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":32,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":3,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","active":true,"slug":"war-conflict","links":"","id":15,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:22:21.512262","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"war & conflict","item_count":28905}],"url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Photo: Hundreds of candles let during memorial for Kayla Mueller in Prescott, Ariz. - @azcentral","slug":"photo-hundreds-of-candles-let-during-memorial-for","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKeT","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/516975\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-hundreds-of-candles-let-during-memorial-for","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":411,"id":65446,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-LGG7cIYAAGdA4.jpg:thumb","width":870,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/azcentral","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-LGG7cIYAAGdA4.jpg","author_name":"azcentral","original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/azcentral\/status\/568234325776437248\/photo\/1","title":"WATCH LIVE: Hundreds of candles being lit in Prescott at Kayla Mueller memorial http:\/\/t.co\/k9w8Wh3Bn5 http:\/\/t.co\/qxYsukl7kq","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":516975,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":30},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/17uErPq","date":"2015-02-19T13:08:01.401186","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/436477421307457536\/0lICCFUR_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"Al_Jazirah","date":"2015-02-19T12:52:42","resource_uri":"","content":"عاجل... سيارة تصطدم بطائرة للخطوط السعودية بمطار جدة \nhttp:\/\/t.co\/G8MJRyltXa\n#مطار_جدة http:\/\/t.co\/tyIKOvKAyv","id":309386,"tweet_id":"568392733049659392","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Al_Jazirah\/status\/568392733049659392","user_id":"244775181","name":"صحيفة الجزيرة","location":"Saudi Arabia, Riyadh"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 01:08 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T13:08:03.656679","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Al_Jazirah\/status\/568392733049659392\/photo\/1","source":null,"push_content":"Saudi Arabia: Car collides with plane on the runway at Jeddah Airport; driver suffers minor injuries - @Al_Jazirah","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/saudi-arabia-car-collides-with-plane-on-the-runwa","topics":[{"longitude":39.1528,"created_on":"2013-04-05T13:03:57","placetype":"Airport","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=912","local_url":"\/topic\/king-abdul-aziz-international-airport-jeddah-makkah-sa\/","geohash":"sggg6bqpw259","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King_Abdulaziz_International_Airport","woeid":23388353,"description":"<p><b>King Abdulaziz International Airport<\/b> (<b>KAIA<\/b>) (Arabic: مطار الملك عبدالعزيز الدولي‎) (IATA: <b>JED<\/b>, ICAO: <b>OEJN<\/b>) is an aviation facility located 19 km to the north of Jeddah.

It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen in the south. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast.<\/p>\n<p>Before the inception of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, modern-day Saudi Arabia consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Hasa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud; he united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. The country has since been an absolute monarchy governed along Islamic lines, namely under the influence of Wahhabism. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"the Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca), and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam.<\/p>\n<p>There are 20 million Saudi citizens and 5 million foreigners living in Saudi Arabia. Most Saudis are Sunni Muslims, approximately 23 percent are Wahhabis, especially those living in Najd. With the world's second largest oil reserves and the world's sixth largest natural gas reserves, Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. The Kingdom is categorized as a high income economy with the 19th highest GDP in the world. It is a member of Gulf Cooperation Council, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, G-20 major economies and OPEC. A large portion of the landscape is uninhabitable desert. Its economy is largely backed by its oil industry, which accounts for more than 95% of exports and 70% of government revenue, although at the turn of the 21st century the government has attempted to diversify the economy away from the oil sector.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ot","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/913\/","latitude":24.2612,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/saudi-arabia\/","livevideo":"","category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=913","active":true,"slug":"saudi-arabia","links":"","id":913,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T13:08:01.401186","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0d\/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saudi_Arabia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Saudi Arabia","item_count":686},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2013-04-30T07:59:45","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=11694","local_url":"\/topic\/air-travel\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Air_travel","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Air travel<\/b> is a form of travel in vehicles such as airplanes, helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliding, parachuting, or anything else that can sustain flight.

It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the West Coast of the United States because of its geographical situation. It is hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as \"Uptown\"), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Broadway Avenue, beyond which is Capitol Hill to the northeast and the Central District to the east; on the south by Dearborn Avenue, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay, which is part of Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean). Belltown, Denny Triangle, the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of First Hill west of Broadway consist of downtown Seattle's chief neighbourhoods. Near the center of downtown is the Metropolitan Tract, owned by the University of Washington, the location of the university's pre-1895 campus. Downtown is Seattle's finance hub, its commercial maritime hub, its centre of nightlife, and its centre of shopping. (The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by way of a monorail). The area is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market, the oldest continually-operating farmer's market in the United States and the core of activity in the area.<\/p>\n<p>Downtown Seattle's Columbia Center has a greater number of floors than any other building west of the Mississippi River, at 76, though there are taller buildings in Texas and California by height. (Smith Tower, in the older section of downtown called Pioneer Square, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi.) Other notable buildings are the Washington Mutual Tower, Two Union Square, Nordstrom’s flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi. Downtown parks include Westlake Park, Freeway Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park.

With an estimated 652,405 residents as of 2013, Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the fastest-growing major city in the United States. The Seattle metropolitan area of around 3.6 million inhabitants is the 14th largest metropolitan area in the United States. The city is situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the 8th largest port in the United States and 9th largest in North America in terms of container handling.<\/p>\n<p>The Seattle area had previously been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to its current site and named \"Seattle\" in 1853, after Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.<\/p>\n<p>Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The city developed as a technology center in the 1980s, with companies like Amazon.com, Microsoft and T-Mobile US based in the area. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Since then, Seattle has become a hub for green industry and a model for sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p>Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street from the current Chinatown\/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix and the alternative rock style grunge.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":9,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bq","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/104\/","latitude":47.6036,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/seattle-wa-us\/","livevideo":"","category":"Town","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=104","active":true,"slug":"seattle-wa-us","links":"","id":104,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T20:15:07.028149","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2f\/Space_Needle002.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seattle\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Seattle, WA, US","item_count":1005},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-13T21:38:46.301982","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=258429","local_url":"\/topic\/antonio-zambrano-montes\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":3,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFON","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/258429\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/antonio-zambrano-montes\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=258429","active":true,"slug":"antonio-zambrano-montes","links":"","id":258429,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T03:18:52.348438","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Antonio Zambrano-Montes","item_count":8},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-17T00:27:43","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=307","local_url":"\/topic\/protests\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Protest","woeid":null,"description":"<p>A <b>protest<\/b> (also called a <b>remonstrance<\/b> or a <b>remonstration<\/b>) is an expression of objection by words or by actions to particular events, policies, or situations.

The Horseshoe Falls lie mostly on the Canadian side and the American Falls entirely on the American side, separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated from the other waterfalls by Luna Island. The international boundary line was originally drawn through Horseshoe Falls in 1819, but the boundary has long been in dispute due to natural erosion and construction.<\/p>\n<p>Located on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls form the highest flow rate of any waterfall in the world, with a vertical drop of more than 165 feet (50 m). Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by vertical height and also by flow rate. The falls are located 17 miles (27 km) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York and 75 miles (121 km) south-southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York.<\/p>\n<p>Niagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.

Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. Because the Chinese calendar is lunisolar, the Chinese New Year is often referred to as the \"<b>Lunar New Year<\/b>\".<\/p>\n<p>The source of Chinese New Year is itself centuries old and gains significance because of several myths and traditions. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honor deities as well as ancestors. Chinese New Year is celebrated in countries and territories with significant Chinese populations, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Philippines, and also in Chinatowns elsewhere. Chinese New Year is considered a major holiday for the Chinese and has had influence on the lunar new year celebrations of its geographic neighbours.<\/p>\n<p>Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Chinese new year vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Chinese New Year's Day is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly cleanse the house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for good incoming luck. Windows and doors will be decorated with red color paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\", \"wealth\", and \"longevity.\" Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are often numbered from the reign of the 3rd millennium BC Yellow Emperor.

A fireworks event (also called a <b>fireworks show<\/b> or <b>pyrotechnics<\/b>) is a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places. Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke and floating materials (confetti for example.) They may be designed to burn with flames and sparks of many colors, typically red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, silver and gold. Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The earliest documentation of fireworks dates back to 7th century China, where they were invented. The fireworks were used to accompany many festivities. It is a part of the culture of China and had its origin there; eventually it spread to other cultures and societies. Important events and festivities such as the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and the Mid-Autumn Festival were and still are times when fireworks are guaranteed sights. China is the largest manufacturer and exporter of fireworks in the world.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fireworks are generally classified as to where they perform, either as a ground or aerial firework. In the latter case they may provide their own propulsion (skyrocket) or be shot into the air by a mortar (aerial shell). The most common feature of fireworks is a paper or pasteboard tube or casing filled with the combustible material, often pyrotechnic stars. A number of these tubes or cases are often combined so as to make, when kindled, a great variety of sparkling shapes, often variously colored. The skyrocket is a common form of firework, although the first skyrockets were used in war. Such rocket technology has also been used for the delivery of mail by rocket and is used as propulsion for most model rockets. The aerial shell is the backbone of today's commercial aerial display. A smaller version for consumer use is known as the festival ball in the United States. There are also ground fireworks which, while less popular than aerial fireworks, can produce various shapes, like rotating circles, stars and 3D globes.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/g7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2043\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fireworks\/","livevideo":"","category":"EntertainmentEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2043","active":true,"slug":"fireworks","links":"","id":2043,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T00:56:40.020790","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d2\/2013_Fireworks_on_Eiffel_Tower_49.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fireworks\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"fireworks","item_count":193}],"url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Photo: People set off fireworks in Shanghai to celebrate Lunar New Year - @johaynz via @AFP","slug":"photo-people-set-off-fireworks-in-shanghai-to-cel","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKd3","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/516949\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-people-set-off-fireworks-in-shanghai-to-cel","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":510,"id":65441,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Kx32EIQAAZ-z7.jpg:thumb","width":768,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AFP","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Kx32EIQAAZ-z7.jpg","author_name":"Agence France-Presse","original_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AFP\/status\/568212076356866048\/photo\/1","title":"People set off fireworks in a street in Shanghai to celebrate the Lunar New Year. #Photo by @johaynz http:\/\/t.co\/1TJSAuYFCV","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":516949,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":28},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1EVjNmS","date":"2015-02-19T09:22:25.984011","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/524391673984331776\/YnICOhl1_normal.jpeg","screen_name":"Amy_Greenbank","date":"2015-02-19T09:15:25","resource_uri":"","content":"CATEGORY 5! #CycloneMarcia now to pack wind gusts to 295km\/hr as it crosses near St Lawrence at 7am @SkyNewsAust http:\/\/t.co\/KSBzpHKP1R","id":309336,"tweet_id":"568338050750681089","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Amy_Greenbank\/status\/568338050750681089","user_id":"48243107","name":"Amy Greenbank","location":"Sydney, NSW"},"date_ap":"Feb 19, 2015, 09:22 AM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-19T09:22:29.113580","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Amy_Greenbank\/status\/568338050750681089\/photo\/1","source":null,"push_content":"Cyclone Marcia expected to make category 5 landfall in the St Lawrence, Queensland area - @BOM_Qld","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/cyclone-marcia-expected-to-make-category-5-landfal","topics":[{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-18T16:46:32.269232","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=258985","local_url":"\/topic\/cyclone-marcia\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":23,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFXL","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/258985\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":6,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclone-marcia\/","livevideo":"","category":"WeatherEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=258985","active":true,"slug":"cyclone-marcia","links":"","id":258985,"kind":"arc","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Cyclone Marcia","item_count":25},{"longitude":144.546,"created_on":"2010-08-10T22:28:13","placetype":"State","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4447","local_url":"\/topic\/queensland-au\/","geohash":"rhrwt5m7s7kt","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Queensland","woeid":2344702,"description":"<p><b>Queensland<\/b> (abbreviated as <b>Qld<\/b>) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in Australia.

To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","id":4448,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.

Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy.<\/p>\n<p>Queensland was first occupied by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa. In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. The colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip at Sydney; New South Wales at that time included all of what is now Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades until the establishment of a penal colony at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. Penal transportation ceased in 1839 and free settlement permitted in 1842.<\/p>\n<p>The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over <i>Cooksland<\/i>, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook.

This is usually characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth. Most large-scale cyclonic circulations are centered on areas of low atmospheric pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. According to the NHC glossary, warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones form as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, cyclones occlude as cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical jet stream.<\/p>\r\n<p>Weather fronts separate two masses of air of different densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Air masses separated by a front may differ in temperature or humidity. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. They form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east. Warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. They move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases under the right conditions. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic basin, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific, and a typhoon in the Northwest Pacific region.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n","daily_count":31,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BJu","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4448\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":7,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cyclones\/","livevideo":"","category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4448","active":true,"slug":"cyclones","links":"","id":4448,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bc\/Low_pressure_system_over_Iceland.jpg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclone\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"cyclones","item_count":295},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=121","local_url":"\/topic\/weather\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather","woeid":null,"description":"<p><b>Weather<\/b> is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc. Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.

When used without qualification, \"weather\", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's <i>Great Red Spot<\/i>, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":52,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B7","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/121\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":11,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/weather\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=121","active":true,"slug":"weather","links":"","id":121,"kind":"vertical","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:40:02.214171","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":"breakingstorm","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fc\/Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weather\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"weather","item_count":27530}],"url_domain":"twitter.com","content":"Photo: Satellite images show Cyclones Lam and Marcia approaching Australia's coasts - @NOAASatellites","slug":"photo-satellite-images-show-cyclones-lam-and-marc","data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKka","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/517354\/","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/photo-satellite-images-show-cyclones-lam-and-marc","author":{"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","id":14,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","last_name":"Stampher","username":"jillian.stamper","is_staff":true,"first_name":"Jillian"},"note":null,"media":{"provider_name":"Twitter","height":576,"id":65533,"html":"","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Ov5-_IgAAWiJ6.png:thumb","width":1024,"thumbnail_height":150,"resource_uri":"","type":"photo","thumbnail_width":150,"author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/noaasatellites","url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/B-Ov5-_IgAAWiJ6.png:large","author_name":"noaasatellites","original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NOAASatellites\/status\/568491389044060161","title":"NOAA Satellites on Twitter","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com"},"type":"text","id":517354,"pushed":false,"status":"published","submitter":"editor","whoas":23},{"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1DDrlfn","date":"2015-02-18T23:27:03.836021","tweet":{"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/57817039\/Riq_BW_normal.jpg","screen_name":"riqparra","date":"2015-02-18T23:15:07","resource_uri":"","content":"@capitalweather - Snow squall line passing through Gaithersburg, MD a little while ago. http:\/\/t.co\/a4kDt45KRD","id":309215,"tweet_id":"568186983404707840","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/riqparra\/status\/568186983404707840","user_id":"15711255","name":"Riq Parra","location":""},"date_ap":"Feb 18, 2015, 11:27 PM GMT","data":null,"updated_date":"2015-02-18T23:27:06.677771","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/riqparra\/status\/568186983404707840\/video\/1","source":null,"push_content":"Video: A snow squall line passing through Gaithersburg, Md, a little while ago - @riqparra","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/18\/video-a-snow-squall-line-passing-through-gaithers","topics":[{"longitude":-77.2139,"created_on":"2012-07-16T23:59:52","placetype":"Town","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3330","local_url":"\/topic\/gaithersburg-md-us\/","geohash":"dqcnemjnqn4v","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gaithersburg,_Maryland","woeid":2408386,"description":"<p><b>Gaithersburg<\/b> ( pronunciation ), officially the <b>City of Gaithersburg<\/b>, is a city located in Montgomery County, Maryland.

Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of Washington, D.C., and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Gaithersburg was incorporated in 1878.<\/p>\n<p>Gaithersburg is divided into east and west sections, separated by Interstate 270. The eastern section of the city is older and is the original portion of the town before more recent growth. Landmarks and buildings from that time can still be seen in many places but especially in the historic central business district of Gaithersburg called \"Olde Town\". The east side also includes Lakeforest Mall, City Hall, and the Montgomery County Fair grounds. The west side of the city has many wealthier neighborhoods that were designed with smart growth techniques and embrace New Urbanism. These include the award-winning Kentlands community, the Lakelands community, and the Washingtonian Center (better known as The Rio), a popular shopping\/business district. Three New Urbanism communities are under construction, including Crown Farm, Watkins Mill Town Center (Casey East and West), and the massive \"Science City\". The state has a bus rapid transit line, Corridor Cities Transitway or \"CCT\", planned for the western portion of the city starting at Shady Grove Metro Station and connecting all the high density western Gaithersburg neighborhoods with a total of eight stops planned in the city.<\/p>\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270.

In mountainous areas, heavy snow is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation, if the atmosphere is cold enough.

Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and borders the U.S. states of New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, and Louisiana to the east. Texas has an area of 268,820 square miles (696,200 km<sup>2<\/sup>) and a growing population of over 26.4 million residents (July 2013).<\/p>\n<p>Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the United States, while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest United States metropolitan areas, respectively. Other major cities include El Paso and Austin—the state capital. Texas is nicknamed the <i>Lone Star State<\/i> to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The \"Lone Star\" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today. The origin of the state name, Texas, is from the word, \"Tejas\", which means 'friends' in the Caddo language.<\/p>\n<p>Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest. Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts, less than 10 percent of the land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The term \"six flags over Texas\", as can be seen in the Grand Prairie-based large national and international amusement park operator <i>Six Flags<\/i>, came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony in Texas. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic. In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican–American War in 1846. A slave state, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the \"Confederate States of America\" on March 2 of the same year. After the consequent Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.<\/p>\n<p>One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle. Due to its long history as a center of the industry, Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy. The state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century, when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","daily_count":5,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PJ","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/939\/","latitude":31.1689,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/texas-us\/","livevideo":"","category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=939","active":true,"slug":"texas-us","links":"","id":939,"kind":"location","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/Flag_of_Texas.svg","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Texas\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"Texas, US","item_count":1731},{"longitude":-97.7716,"created_on":"2012-08-20T18:12:40","placetype":"County","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=22667","local_url":"\/topic\/travis-tx-us\/","geohash":"9v6kx0susdg5","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travis_County,_Texas","woeid":12590233,"description":"<p><b>Travis County<\/b> is a county located in south central Texas.

Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is sometimes referred to as <b>marriage equality<\/b> or <b>equal marriage<\/b>, particularly by supporters. The legalization of same-sex marriage is characterized as \"redefining marriage\" by many opponents.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. As of 28 June 2014, sixteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, Uruguay) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of Mexico and the United States) allow same-sex couples to marry. The law in Luxembourg will come into force on 1 January 2015. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via a ballot initiative or a referendum). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, human rights and civil rights issue, as well as a religious issue in many nations and around the world, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, or instead be allowed to hold a different status (a civil union), or be denied such rights. Same-sex marriage can provide same-sex couples who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of opposite-sex married couples. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex couples benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions. Court documents filed by American scientific associations also state that singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them. The American Anthropological Association avers that social science research does not support the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon not recognizing same-sex marriage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting. Various faith communities around the world support allowing same-sex couples to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: Buddhism in Australia, Church of Sweden, Conservative Judaism, U.S. Episcopalians, Humanistic Judaism, Native American religions with a two-spirit tradition, Druids, the Metropolitan Community Church, Quakers, Reconstructionist Judaism, Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalists, the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, and Wiccans, as well as various other progressive and modern Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish groups and various minor religions and other denominations.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","daily_count":4,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B1","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/115\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/same-sex-marriage\/","livevideo":"","category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=115","active":true,"slug":"same-sex-marriage","links":"","id":115,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T21:29:53.815025","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ed\/Major_Alan_G._Roger_at_Same-Sex_Wedding_Ceremony.jpg","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Same-sex_marriage\">Wikipedia<\/a>","name":"same-sex marriage","item_count":983},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-19T16:59:13.354372","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=259155","local_url":"\/topic\/sarah-goodfriend\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFZ5","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/259155\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sarah-goodfriend\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=259155","active":true,"slug":"sarah-goodfriend","links":"","id":259155,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T17:01:15.923621","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Sarah Goodfriend","item_count":1},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-19T16:59:13.383120","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=259156","local_url":"\/topic\/suzanne-bryant\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"","woeid":null,"description":"","daily_count":1,"muted_by_default":false,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFZ6","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/259156\/","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/suzanne-bryant\/","livevideo":"","category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=259156","active":true,"slug":"suzanne-bryant","links":"","id":259156,"kind":"tag","latest_item_date":"2015-02-19T17:01:15.923621","facebookchat":"","twitter_username":null,"image_url":"","image_credit":"","name":"Suzanne Bryant","item_count":1},{"longitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","placetype":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","geohash":"","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","woeid":null,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the West Coast of the United States because of its geographical situation. It is hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as \"Uptown\"), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Broadway Avenue, beyond which is Capitol Hill to the northeast and the Central District to the east; on the south by Dearborn Avenue, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay, which is part of Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean). Belltown, Denny Triangle, the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of First Hill west of Broadway consist of downtown Seattle's chief neighbourhoods. Near the center of downtown is the Metropolitan Tract, owned by the University of Washington, the location of the university's pre-1895 campus. Downtown is Seattle's finance hub, its commercial maritime hub, its centre of nightlife, and its centre of shopping. (The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by way of a monorail). The area is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market, the oldest continually-operating farmer's market in the United States and the core of activity in the area.<\/p>\n<p>Downtown Seattle's Columbia Center has a greater number of floors than any other building west of the Mississippi River, at 76, though there are taller buildings in Texas and California by height. (Smith Tower, in the older section of downtown called Pioneer Square, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi.) Other notable buildings are the Washington Mutual Tower, Two Union Square, Nordstrom’s flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi. Downtown parks include Westlake Park, Freeway Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park.

With an estimated 652,405 residents as of 2013, Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the fastest-growing major city in the United States. The Seattle metropolitan area of around 3.6 million inhabitants is the 14th largest metropolitan area in the United States. The city is situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the 8th largest port in the United States and 9th largest in North America in terms of container handling.<\/p>\n<p>The Seattle area had previously been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to its current site and named \"Seattle\" in 1853, after Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.<\/p>\n<p>Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The city developed as a technology center in the 1980s, with companies like Amazon.com, Microsoft and T-Mobile US based in the area. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Since then, Seattle has become a hub for green industry and a model for sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p>Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street from the current Chinatown\/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson and others.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The war followed the September 11 attacks, and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda. The Taliban asked bin Laden to leave the country, but declined to extradite him without evidence of his involvement in the 9\/11 attacks. The United States refused to negotiate and launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance. The U.S. and its allies drove the Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries. NATO members provided the core of the force. One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct U.S. command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement and in 2003 launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.<\/p>\n<p>Though vastly outgunned and outnumbered, the Taliban insurgents, most notably the Haqqani Network and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces. The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan. ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to \"clear and hold\" villages and \"nation building\" projects to \"win hearts and minds\".<\/p>\n<p>While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan. In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The US military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders. This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>On 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan. In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces. UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban. In May 2014, the United States announced that its combat operations would end in 2014, leaving just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war.
