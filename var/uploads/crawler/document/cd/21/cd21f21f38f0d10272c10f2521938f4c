Add that to the news that the U.S. economy added more jobs so far in 2014 than in any year of President George W. Bush’s administration, and you’ll see why Democrats are looking forward to 2016.</p>

			<h3>Myth</h3>
			<p>Raising the minimum wage will cost the economy jobs.</p>

		<div class="fact message">
			<h3>Fact</h3>
			<p>We don’t need to rely on theories for this one: Thirteen states raised the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014, so let’s look at what happened there. The average for job growth in states that did not raise the minimum wage was 0.61%, but <a href="http://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23FACT%3A%20States%20that%20decided%20to%20%23RaiseTheWage%20saw%20faster%20job%20growth%20in%202014%3A%20yourrepublicanuncle.com%2F%23pay-equity" class="popup tweet">the average for those thirteen states that raised the wage was 0.85% -- even better&nbsp;<span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>. So not only would raising the minimum wage directly help 28 million workers, we have already seen states that have raised the wage this year experience greater job growth.</p>

			<h3>Fact</h3>
			<p>Only 12% of those who would benefit from a minimum wage increase are teenagers &#8212; the other 88% are age 20 or older, often with households to support. Also, did you know that <a href="http://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23FACT%3A%20Adult%20women%20are%20most%20likely%20to%20work%20minimum%20wage%20jobs.%20It%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20%23RaiseTheWage.%20yourrepublicanuncle.com%2F%23pay-equity" class="popup tweet">women are more likely than men to find themselves working a minimum wage job&nbsp;<span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>? That's part of why President Obama supports  an increase in the minimum wage &#8212; because raising the minimum wage would benefit  28 million Americans and strengthen the middle class.</p>
