	                    <p>Since you got the news, you have begun gather the things your new bundle of joy will be needing. If this is your first baby you may be overwhelmed by all the decisions at first. The type of stroller you will use for your baby is one of the biggest decisions you will need to make.</p>
<p>Your budget is the first thing to consider when you are choosing from among the many different types of strollers. Stroller costs can range from $10 to $400 and higher. The lower end strollers are generally the light weight umbrella strollers.</p>
<p>These strollers are advantageous because they are easy to fold and can store almost anywhere. The features and quality of the stroller may increase as the prices increase. Strollers come with a variety of features and you must decide which ones are most important to you.</p>
<p>Do you prefer a regular stroller and a car seat or a convertible travel system? There are travel systems that come with a stay in the car base, an infant carrier/ car safety seat, and a stroller frame for the infant seat to which it is attached.</p>
<p>These are wonderful especially for your newborn baby. A play tray that has places for a bottle or juice cup come with strollers. Canopies with a vinyl window come with many strollers so you can keep an eye on the baby.</p>
<p>Many strollers come with easily applied footbrakes that are attached to the both rear wheels and some include a wrist strap break that is used with the foot break. It provides a bit of extra safety preventing the stroller from rolling away while you are stopped while you use have the strap on.</p>
<p>Many strollers are now coming with a parent tray that fits over the handlebar and a large storage basket under the seat(s). It has insets for a cup of coffee or a soda, your cell phone, keys, and a snack. Now on many strollers the handle bars are reversible and can be moved from front to rear or vice versa and they are height adjustable.</p>
<p>The reversible handle bars can help you to see your baby while he rides if necessary and the height adjustable feature is a great back saver. The seat must be considered next. Is the seat able to recline and if it is will your newborn be able to lie almost flat if it reclines enough.</p>
<p>Is the seat comfortable and well padded for your baby? Can you remove the seat padding to wash it? Most strollers that have blankets that attach under the seat are on the upper end. These blankets on your baby&#8217;s stroller like a bunting on wheels.</p>
<p>Rain hood can be detached and are used also to protect your baby from wind and harsh sunlight. The decision about your baby stroller has another twist. Your friend has a free almost brand new stroller that you can have.</p>
<p>She agrees to clean it and have it ready for you. Will it be a safe choice to use a used stroller for your baby? For you and your baby this could be a good choice but you will have to look over some things before your baby rides in it.</p>
<p>There should be cracks, dents, or gaps in the frame. Bolts and screws must all be in place Anything less could cause an accident, seriously injuring your baby. Are there any sharp spots on the frame? Are there screws sticking out that could cut your baby or that are loose?</p>
<p>The frame must be properly joined to the frame; is it? Do you need to check of leaks in the air pressure of the wheels or are they solid? The wheels; are they worn? The wheels, do they need replacing?</p>
<p>Are the wheels turning appropriately? The axels; are they straight? Do the brakes operate correctly by holding when they are applied? No matter if the seat  is in straight us position or reclining position, does the seat hold? A seat that does not hold its place could cause serious injury to the baby.</p>
<p>Does the seat lining fit the frame properly and is it clean? A variety of options, styles and types of strollers are available. Strollers are available with multiple seats for two or more children.</p>
<p>There is a variety of seating arrangements including tandem and side by seating as well as stadium seating which a variation of tandem seating where the rear seat is higher than the front allowing the second child to see more than just the back of a head.</p>
<p>Jogging strollers have one large wheel out in front and two rear wheels. Multiple seating is also an option with jogging strollers. Whether the stroller is used or new! Enjoy outings with your child or children.</p>

	                    <p>Nowadays, everyone wants their children to be the smartest in the neighborhood. They spend all kinds of money on high tech gadgets made by companies that claim they can make your child incredibly intelligent. Sure, that sounds like a great idea. On the other hand, you have parents complaining because their kids are growing up too fast. The world is confusing – do we want our kids to enjoy their childhoods or be more intelligent at an earlier age?</p>
<p>Even baby toys are being geared towards mind stimulation. There are baby toys that have bright colors for mind stimulation. There are baby toys that speak different languages. Shouldn’t our kids learn their own primary language before having toys that speak multiple languages? Whatever happened to baby toys that allow babies to be babies? Some of the best toys for our babies are the ones that rattle and roll – allowing them to giggle and learn about how to make sounds and things move.</p>
<p>When my daughter was little, I was more focused on making sure that my daughter enjoyed being a child. Her baby toys were cute, cuddly, colorful and noisy. I wasn’t showing her flashcards at the age of six months old and teaching her how to add and subtract. I was rolling around on the floor with her, teaching her about animals and colors. Her baby toys allowed her to be a baby.</p>
<p>One of the best things that I ever purchased for her wasn’t a baby toy, but a video. She loved the Baby Einstein videos. The music and colors kept her captivated for the entire length of the video. While I cannot say for certain that her brain was being stimulated and she was learning things, I can say that it certainly wasn’t harmful to her.</p>
<p>You really can’t go wrong with purchasing baby toys. Perhaps the toys require your infant to be lying on their stomach for some ‘tummy time’ and strengthening their muscles, which is something that all babies need. Or, perhaps you’re more focused on having your child learn colors and sounds. No matter what toy your infant or toddler is using on a daily basis, their minds are being stimulated. In my opinion, we don’t need to be focusing on creating baby geniuses. We need to be focusing on raising healthy, happy and intelligent children. There isn’t a need to be pushing for anything more than that.</p>

	                    <!-- article-content -->
	                    <p>Purchasing a baby stroller is as an important decision as purchasing a crib or a car seat.  There are so many choices to choose from and each baby stroller holds a multitude of features.  They also range in prices from inexpensive to expensive which is why it is important to choose the right stroller from the start.  While staying within a budget is important, you may be better off spending a little more for a baby stroller up front, rather than buying a cheap stroller and having it break after a couple of months.</p>
<p>The most important features to consider when buying a stroller are the safety features.  Buying a new stroller makes it easier to check for various safety features required in baby strollers.  First off check that the stroller has an adequate breaking system.  Also be sure that the proper safety harness is in place (usually a 5 point safety harness) and check that there is a crotch strap as well.  A crotch strap will prevent your baby from sliding out of the stroller.</p>
<p>Other features which are not critical but help are things like adjustable handles.  You are more than likely not the only person who will be pushing the stroller so adjustable handles are very helpful.  You may also want to consider a stroller made from washable material or has Scotchguard protection to limit staining.  Newer model strollers are usually built with stain guard fabrics.</p>
<p>Storage space is also a plus in a good stroller.  You will need to have space for things such as a diaper bag, baby formula, as well as having room to carry any extra bags.  After storage space consideration, your next feature check is how well will your stroller store?  You will want one that will fold easily and open easily because you will be moving that stroller in and out of the car or storing it in a closet, etc.  The last thing you want to be doing is fighting with a stroller every time you need to use it or put it away.</p>
<p>If you are an active parent, you may consider the jogging stroller.  Jogging strollers are great for the mom or dad who wants to get in their exercise with their baby.  The only downside to these strollers are that they are usually not made for carrying extra bags and are generally not lightweight.  Another issue is they are not recommended for newborns.  If you are into exercising, you are probably better off purchasing two separate strollers, one for daily use and one for jogging or running.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is the features that you will need on a regular basis.  Safety features go without saying but some parents need more storage in there strollers where as some parents rather have a lighter weight stroller that is easy to store.  It may help to write down the features you are looking for in a stroller and then researching particular brands to see which one fits your needs best.</p>

	                    <p>When choosing a baby carrier you have two basic options.  These two options include the standard baby carriers that often resemble a backpack (worn on either the back or front) or the baby sling.  More often than not, a parent may select the traditional style baby carrier because they are not sure about the many benefits a baby sling can provide.  Another drawback is that since many parents aren&#8217;t familiar with the baby sling, they may not feel it is secure enough to hold their baby.  However, baby slings can be just as secure as a traditional baby carrier, yet hold many more benefits in the long run.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of a baby sling is the way the baby is positioned close to their parent as opposed to the backpack style of carry that the typical baby carriers offer.  The sling carry is more convenient for infants who need constant attention.  Being close to mom or dad offers that special bonding time while allowing the parent to tend to her daily routines such as housework or taking care of older children in the home as well.</p>
<p>Another huge benefit of the baby sling is the way they help alleviate back pain for mom or dad.  Parents know that carrying around their little one can wreak havoc on the back, causing back pain or irritating an already existing problem.  Since the baby sling distributes the baby&#8217;s weight more evenly, you are less likely to position your lower back in uncomfortable positions to accommodate the weight of your baby.  The traditional carriers often mean carrying your infant on your back and after a couple of hours, you will begin to feel the discomfort on your lower back.  The baby sling will help reduce back discomfort enough to where it may not even be an issue.</p>
<p>The best benefit of all when it comes to the baby sling is the closeness you will have with your young one.  Infants need the constant touch and attention from their mom or dad.  Being close to your child at this early stage of their lives is not spoiling the child which is a common myth.  This closeness and bonding is a critical time for both parent and baby.  Rather then leaving your infant alone in their crib to fuss or cry while you do housework, you can spend that time bonding.</p>
<p>Other little benefits include the calming effect of being carried regularly.  This can prove beneficial if your baby is colic and is extremely fussy and crying.  You may find that carrying your baby in a baby sling actually decreases the amount of crying on a daily basis.  Your baby will also benefit from being up and about, rather than lying in a crib all day.  Your baby will be more alert, reacting to the things around you both such as interacting with others or noticing new sounds and colors.</p>
<p>A typical baby carrier cannot offer these types of benefits.  While they are great for long treks around town, they cannot offer the same closeness and face to face interaction with your infant that a baby sling can.</p>

	                    <p>Your new baby is a precious addition to your family, and you want to keep every little memory safe in a scrapbook – conventional or digital. You have so many cute pictures – many of them with your baby sleeping. You want to feature your baby sleeping with scrapbook page layout ideas that show how sweet your little boy or girl is.</p>
<p>Baby Sleeping Themes</p>
<p>Scrapbook page layout ideas should begin with themes. In this case, you have chosen a theme of baby sleeping, but you may want to consider something that is not so broad.</p>
<p>1. Does baby pout when sleeping? Your theme could be “precious pouter”.</p>
<p>2. If baby sleeps with heaps of toys, a theme might be “our priceless toy”.</p>
<p>3. “Knitting up the raveled sleeve of care” is a Shakespearean theme that could feature baby sleeping.</p>
<p>As you consider scrapbook page layout ideas, open your mind to a variety of themes.</p>
<p>Baby Sleeping Layout Starters</p>
<p>You can get your creative juices flowing by looking at page layout ideas others have created. Here are 7 page layout ideas to get you started:</p>
<p>1. Baby Sleeping at Baptism: Page layout ideas for a baptism look good with ribbons and lace in antique off-white shades. Use a background paper in a rich wine shade. If baby received a certificate of baptism, this can be used along with photos. Focus attention on baby sleeping by making that photo prominent, framing it in lace. Include photos of parents and others who were a part of the occasion. A row of photos across the top of a 2-page spread could be set off from the rest of the page with a lace ribbon. Be sure the baby’s full name is included in rich lettering.</p>
<p>2. Baby Sleeping in Pink: Scrapbook page layout ideas for a little girl in pink will look good with a sprinkling of sugar and spice. Background paper can be a cinnamon brown textured paper. A dictionary definition of “spice” on a torn antique ivory paper could be topped with one photo of baby sleeping. Write “sugar” on a tag, and add a ribbon. Don’t forget a bit of journaling to tell about baby’s sleep habits. Embellishment candies will carry your theme beautifully.</p>
<p>3. Baby Sleeping in Blue: One of the cute page layout ideas you may want to consider is one that centers on a “Little Boy Blue” theme. Begin with a background in pale blues and whites. Perhaps a wide stripe patterned paper, or even a piece of blue and white fabric would work well. Mount your “baby sleeping” photo on the background with black corners. Add a photo or two of the many “blue” things in his life. Stack blue blankets, sleepers, toys – anything blue – and snap a few photos for further page layout ideas. Add blue embellishments, stickers, and a memento such as a piece of a blue blanket or favorite clothing. Journal in dark blue ink, making your notes encircle the page as a border.</p>
<p>4. Baby Sleeping at Birth: For page layout ideas that feature your baby sleeping during the first weeks of life, consider adding a copy of the birth certificate. If it has footprints on the back, be sure you use a copy of those, too. For digital page layout ideas, consider scanning the foot prints onto your hard drive. Then, in a graphics program, give them a transparent layer. Beneath that, insert a layer with the word “baby” in pastel colors, one color per letter. A few extra “feet” would be a cute embellishment. Frame your baby in pastel frames.</p>
<p>5. Baby Sleeping on Baby Sheets: Scrapbook page layout ideas for a baby asleep might begin with a background of sheet fabric. If you have the actual crib sheets on which baby slept, you might cut a piece the size of your page, and use it for a background. Mount your photos on torn paper in one of the brighter colors from the sheet. If the sheet has pictures of baby animals or toys, use similar embellishments and stickers. Add a corner of baby’s favorite blanket as a memento, and a note about how your boy or girl loved it.</p>
<p>6. Baby Sleeping in Family Tree: This is one of those page layout ideas that work well in a family heritage scrapbook. Start with a family tree background that uses a nostalgic tree graphic with family names arranged on it. Don’t worry about covering some names. This is just background for this page. mount your baby sleeping in a cradle cut out. Place the cradle strategically in the tree. Photos of parents or grandparents asleep as babies in the 40’s or 50’s would be fun for comparison. Who does baby resemble more? Add a few bird stickers. Journal on leaf shapes. Add a border of leaves.</p>
<p>7. Baby Sleeping at Dinner: Many babies fall asleep in the high chair, their tiny heads ending up on the tray. Scrapbook page layout ideas that feature such a photo can carry through the dinner theme. Can you tell what was served the time the photo was taken? If it was baby food from jars, get identical jars and set up a photo of what was on the menu. Write out the menu for more interest. Add a menu item of “Zzzzzzzz”. If baby sleeping was at a home-made meal, include a recipe as one of your page layout ideas. Arrange a few teddy bear stickers and a spoon.</p>
<p>Whatever scrapbook page layout ideas are used, you will want to remember that each page is a canvas on which you paint a picture. Imagine each scrapbook page hung on the wall of a gallery or displayed on an art easel. All page layout ideas should tell stories without additional comments.</p>

	                    <!-- article-content -->
	                    <p>Since you got the news, you have begun gather the things your new bundle of joy will be needing. Decisions for your first baby may seem overwhelming at first. The type of stroller you will use for your baby is one of the biggest decisions you will need to make. When you are choosing from among the many different types of baby strollers, one of the first things to consider is your budget.</p>
<p>Stroller costs can range from $10 to $400 and higher. The very light weight umbrella strollers are general on the lower end. The advantage of these strollers is that they can be folded up nicely, and can store almost anywhere. The higher prices of strollers may indicate more features and better quality.</p>
<p>The features that come with strollers are many and you should know which ones are important to you. A convertible travel system may be your preference over a regular stroller and a car seat. Travel systems have a stay in the car base, a stroller frame to attach the infant carrier/ car safety seat to.</p>
<p>For your newborn baby these are especially great. Play trays with places for a bottle or juice cup come on strollers. Canopies with a vinyl window to let you keep an eye on the baby, come with many strollers. Strollers are equipped with breaks that are attached to both rear wheels and applied with your foot and also a wrist brake strap that is used with the foot brake.</p>
<p>It provides a bit of extra safety preventing the stroller from rolling away while you are stopped while you use have the strap on. A parent tray that is placed over the handle bar are coming with many strollers as well as a large storage basket under the seat(s).</p>
<p>There is space for a cup of coffee or soda, your cell phone, your keys and space to hold a snack. Now on many strollers the handle bars are reversible and can be moved from front to rear or vice versa and they are height adjustable. To save your back use the height adjustable feature and you can see your baby while he rides if necessary by using the reversible handle bar.</p>
<p>The seat consideration is next. If the seat reclines does it recline enough so that  your newborn can lie almost flat. Is the seat comfortable and well padded for your baby? Is the padding for the seat removable for washing? Many upper end strollers have blankets with snaps that attach under the seat.</p>
<p>These blankets on your baby&#8217;s stroller like a bunting on wheels. Detachable rain hoods are used to protect your baby from wind  and harsh sunlight. There is another twist to your decision about a baby stroller. An almost brand-new stroller is available for free from your friend.</p>
<p>She agrees to have the stroller cleaned and ready for you. Is it a safe choice to put your baby in a used stroller? There are things you will need to look at before you place your baby in it and it can be a good choice for your baby and you. No cracks, should be in the frame, and there should be no dents or gaps.</p>
<p>Bolts and screws all must be in place. Anything less could seriously hurt your baby and cause an accident. On the frame are there any sharp spots? Are any screws sticking out that could cut your baby or are loose? The handle bar and frame, are they properly joined? Are there leaks in the air pressure of the wheels or are they solid?</p>
<p>Regarding the wheels, are they worn? Do you need to possibly replace the wheels? Are the wheels turning as they should be? Do the axels seem straight? Do the brakes operate appropriately and hold when they are applied? Does the seat hold its  position in the upright position or the reclining position?</p>
<p>A serious injury could happen to your baby if the seat does not hold its place well. Does the lining fit the frame properly and is it clean? Strollers come with a wide variety of options, types, and styles. Two or more children can use multi-seated  strollers.

	                    <p>As a new parent, one of your priorities will be to establish good sleeping habits with your newborn. Your baby needs to learn to sleep on his own; the transition from sleeping with his mother to sleeping by himself takes some time. Of course, as add added bonus, if you get your baby to learn to sleep on his own you will also get some much needed rest yourself. To instill good sleeping habits in your baby, research and try to employ different baby sleep tips: try a lot of things and see what works for you, and don&#8217;t be afraid to trust your instincts.</p>
<p>Many baby sleep tips center on the idea of establishing routines and associations for your child between nighttime and sleep. The sooner you child begins to associate bedtime with sleep, the more likely he is to be able to go to sleep without a fuss. A period that is often overlooked, however, in establishing day vs. night associations, is the period of &#8220;transition&#8221; &#8211; that is, the one between being awake and falling asleep. Here are some transitioning techniques to try:</p>
<p>Try what is sometimes called &#8220;fathering down.&#8221; Just before placing the baby into bed, the father should cradle the baby in such a way that the baby&#8217;s head rests on the father neck. The father should then talk gently to the child. Because the male&#8217;s voice is much deeper than the female&#8217;s, babies are often more soothed by it, and will fall asleep more easily after being exposed to it for some time.</p>
<p>You can also try what is sometimes referred to as &#8220;wearing down.&#8221; This is effective if your baby has been active throughout the day and is too excited to go to bed easily. All you have to do is place your baby in a sling or carrier &#8211; &#8220;wear him&#8221; in other words &#8211; for about half an hour before his bedtime. Simply go about your regular household activities: being close to a parent and slowly rocked about before bedtime will provide your child with an easier transition from being awake to being asleep.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;ve exhausted other options, you can go for the tried and true method of &#8220;driving down.&#8221; Most parents are probably familiar with this as a last resort: place your baby in the car and drive around for awhile until he falls asleep. This one, while inconvenient, usually works every time, and if you desperately need some sleep it can be a godsend.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&#8217;t want to do things like drive around every night to get your child to sleep. Nor do you want to have to carry him around in a sling. The idea, though, is to start with these more drastic techniques and then slowly ease out of them. Keep in mind what a major transition your baby is going through when he is tiny: he&#8217;s never slept on his own before. He simply doesn&#8217;t know how to transition himself from being awake to being asleep. By employing these transition techniques you will be slowly teaching him how to do so, and as they are gradually removed your baby will learn good sleeping habits, which will ensure that both you and your child get a good night&#8217;s rest.</p>

	                    <p>Congratulations you have a new baby! Having a new baby is hard enough but when you choose to breastfeed you sometimes feel that you made this experience even harder. Breastfeeding is not as difficult as it looks or as you may have heard from others. It is actually pretty easy and a very fulfilling way to nourish your newborn once you get the hang of it. Remember as with most things practice makes perfect! Breastfeeding is new to you and to your little one but with a little practice you two will become pros in no time!</p>
<p>During the first week of your baby’s life, your breasts will produce colostrum for your baby to drink. Colostrum is rich in antibodies and aids the baby’s immune system. It also helps him pass his first bowel movement, which is called meconium. Meconium is black and tarry looking and is in the first few diapers after birth. Then he begins to transition to a brown substance and after your milk comes in, it becomes a yellow, mustardy stool that is loose and watery. Bottle-fed babies pass firmer, tannish stools than breastfed babies.</p>
<p>After 24-48 hours after birth, your baby will start having wet diapers that will increase to two or three a day.</p>
<p>Your technique and positioning is a very important factor in ensuring that your breastfeeding experience is a great one. There are a few different positions that can be used to make the experience more comfortable for you and baby. Some of these positions include:</p>
<p>• Laying down &#8211; Lay down on you side with pillows behind you to support your back. Lay baby facing you with her head on a pillow your breast should be level with baby’s mouth. Bend your legs with a pillow between your knees and then have baby latch on.</p>
<p>• Sitting Up – Sit up either in bed or a comfortable chair or couch with pillows supporting your back and head. Place a pillow on your lap and put baby on top of the pillow in your arms, you can rest your arms on the pillow to make it easier to bring baby up to your breast. Bend your knees to make this even easier have baby latch on.</p>
<p>• The Clutch Hold – This is also known as the football hold. This position is also good when nursing twins as it allows mom to have a baby on each side. Sit down and tuck your baby under your arm almost like a handbag. Rest baby’s head on a firm pillow on your lap. Ensure that baby’s feet are behind your back. Your hand is at the back of baby’s neck, not on baby’s head. Your arm will extend down baby’s back , guide baby to latch on</p>
<p>These are just a few of the positions that you can use there is also the cradle hold, clutch hold, and the transition position. Do some research to learn these other positions to nurse your baby if you find the above positions uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While your baby drinks colostrum and then milk, you should listen for a pattern of “suck, suck, suck, swallow.” This pattern will be rhythmic and there should be no “clicking” noises. The “clicking” sound can indicate that your baby is not properly latched on and may not be getting enough milk from you. If you start to hear this, you need to unlatch him and then reattach him. If you continue to hear this sound after reattaching him several times, then you may want to consult a lactation consultant or your pediatrician.</p>
<p>After the first week of life, you should see 6-8 wet diapers each day and at least 3 bowel movements a day. His urine should be clear and he should become more alert with each passing day. Your baby should also be gaining weight and growing, as this is the surest way to tell that they are getting enough nutrition. If you have two days in a row that deviates from the above indicators, then you should call your pediatrician immediately.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding problems, such as milk production difficulties, are not as common when using the PDF feeding method, but they do occur. Even if you are well rested, eating healthy, have a pretty routine life, and your baby is growing and getting enough food, you still may experience a milk production issue. Many things can cause production problems. Here are just a few.</p>
<p>Some things that can affect your milk supply are:</p>
<p>• What mom eats<br />
• How much mom rests and sleeps<br />
• Her state of mind<br />
• The age of the mom<br />
• How many children you have<br />
• Your desire to breastfeed<br />
• Your nursing capabilities<br />
• Your nursing techniques<br />
• Baby’s latch on abilities</p>
<p>If you choose to breastfeed, it is very important that you take your baby for their check-ups as needed. If you don’t, how will you know if he is getting enough milk and growing at the correct rate? There is no way for you to tell that your child is getting enough nutrition for sure without your child being weighed.</p>

	                    <!-- article-content -->
	                    <p>Every parent of a newborn will inevitably deal with many sleepless nights. Babies, of course, have many needs, and when they awake in the night they will cry for their mothers. One of your most important tasks as a parent is to establish good sleeping habits in your child. Every baby must go through a transition where he adjusts from sleeping with his mother to sleeping on his own. This is a natural transition of course, and takes some time, but there are things you can do to expedite the process. Not only will this help your child develop better sleep habits, it will allow you to get some much needed rest.</p>
<p>Many baby sleep tips exist, and every parent would be well advised to research many different baby sleep tips. It is important to keep in mind, however, that no baby sleep tip should be considered hard and fast rules. As a parent, your instincts know best, and when you are in doubt in regards to baby sleep tips remind yourself of this fact. Many first time parents experience insecurity in terms of whether their decisions and strategies are correct, and while you shouldn&#8217;t be uninformed, you should always view baby sleep tips through the lens of your own parental instincts.</p>
<p>Now, one thing you should consider when trying to get your newborn to sleep better at night is what his feeding habits are. Oftentimes the child will be active and otherwise busy during the day, and won&#8217;t be doing a lot of feeding. The problem with this, of course, is that he will then wake you repeatedly thought the night for feedings. A good technique, then, for getting your baby to sleep better at night is to &#8220;tank up&#8221; during the day. Try feeding every three hours during the day. This will not only ensure that you child&#8217;s appetite is satisfied for the night, but will create an important association: you want your child to associate feeding with the daytime. If your child does wake up in the night for a feeding, try to get him to do one full feeding the first time he wakes up. If you don&#8217;t do this, you encourage him to &#8220;snack&#8221; throughout the night &#8211; i.e. wake you up every couple hours.</p>
<p>Again, it is important to understand these baby feeding tips should not be taken as hard and fast rules, but rather as guidance. In a general way, you want to create both daytime and sleep associations for your child. You want him to associate feeding and play with something that happens during the day, and lullabies and baths as something that happens at night, before bed. By doing this you ease the transition between sleep and wakefulness, which is the ultimate goal in terms of putting your child to bed easily. If, however, your child doesn&#8217;t want to feed every three hours, don&#8217;t force him. Similarly, don&#8217;t force a full feeding when you wake him at night. Rather, think of the bigger picture: by creating general habits and associations for your child, you will ensure a hasty and healthy sleep development.</p>

	                    <p>Everyone who has had the experience of being a parent knows all too well the difficulties of getting your baby to sleep soundly throughout the night. The dark circles around the eyes of new parents are usually familiar to all those that have been around them. In terms of baby sleep tips, one of the most important things you must try and establish as a parent is getting your baby to learn to fall asleep on his own. The process by which your child begins to fall asleep on his own is one that involves a natural transition from falling asleep with the mother to falling asleep in an independent fashion. One of the best ways in which you can speed up this transition is to encourage your child to develop sleep associations that he or she can recreate independently.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone &#8211; and babies in particular &#8211; will develop sleep associations. These are the things that you associate with bedtime, and allow you to create an environment in which it is easy to fall asleep. When your baby is at an extremely young age, he will naturally develop sleep associations involving the mother, as he will often fall asleep in her arms. As you attempt to get your baby to sleep in his own, however, it is crucial that you work to change these associations.</p>
<p>If you always put your child to sleep by holding him, or allowing him to use a pacifier, you create a sleep association with these things. Then, when your child wakes up in the middle of then night, he can&#8217;t go back to sleep on his own because he is unable to recreate his sleeping environment without you: he needs you to feed him or rock him in order to sleep.</p>
<p>As you begin to try and get your child to sleep on his own, you should introduce items into his sleeping routine that he can sleep with, such as a particular blanket or a stuffed animal. What this will do is create associations for your child with these items for sleep. Then, when he awakes in the middle of the night, he will be able to recreate a sleeping environment without your assistance by grabbing his stuffed animal, etc. It can also be beneficial to introduce &#8220;transitional items&#8221; into your baby&#8217;s bedtime routine: Allow him to have his stuffed animal or blanket with him during a final feeding and before-bedtime activities, and allow him to take these things with him to bed.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, your child is going to be creating his or her own sleep associations. Your job is to try and create associations with items that are under his or her control. By giving your child as much control over his sleeping environment as possible, you allow him to begin to achieve sleep independently. The most difficult transition in early parenting is the one towards independent sleep for your child, and if you introduce new items into your child&#8217;s sleeping place, you will hasten this transition, which will soon allow both you and your child to get a good night&#8217;s rest.</p>
