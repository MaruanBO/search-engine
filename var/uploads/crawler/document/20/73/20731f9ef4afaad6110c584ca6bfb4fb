<p style="margin:0;">by <b>Bassam Tawil</b> &nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp; February 19, 2015 at 5:00 am</p>

<blockquote class="content_preface" style="margin-top:0 !important;"><p>Commentators in Europe voicing opinions on the terrorist attacks at <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> and the kosher supermarket in Paris, reverentially discussed the motivation of the terrorists, but showed distressingly little understanding of the meaning of <i>jihad</i>.</p>
<p>Europe, hedonist and dishonest, is apparently willing to cut a deal with any violent dictator, including the most potentially violent: a nuclear-threshold Iran.</p>
<p>To understand the fate awaiting Europe, it is necessary to listen seriously to what the upper echelons of Islam say to each other about their intentions -- <i>in Arabic.</i> These messages are quite different from those on Western television. What they say to each other is that the mission of Islam is to lead the whole world and eradicate all other religions, as they have been made irrelevant by the Qur'an.</p>
<p><i>Charlie Hebdo's</i> cover after the attacks illustrates the very weakness exploited by the Islamists. The cover shown Muhammad, with a tear, aligning himself with humanism. To every Muslim on the planet, it shouted France's weakness, its increasing surrender to the Islamist threat, and the growing strength of Islam.</p>
<p>The real threat to Europe does not come from local Muslims who went to fight in the ranks of ISIS. The real threat comes from Muslims already in the enclaves in Europe. Their doctrine appears openly and without reservation, in books and on websites. It is spread in local languages in mosques by the imams in their communities. These communities command immigration; then the forming of enclaves in the host country, then the eventual violent takeover of the host.</p></blockquote>

To understand and explain the fate awaiting Europe, it is necessary to listen seriously to what the upper echelons of Islam say to each about their own intentions -- <i>in Arabic</i>.

<p style="margin:0;">by <b>Shoshana Bryen</b> &nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp; February 19, 2015 at 4:00 am</p>

<blockquote class="content_preface" style="margin-top:0 !important;"><p>How does a government "get beyond the crisis" without a plan to resolve the crisis?</p>
<p>The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) is an odd document, not yet debated Congress. Among other points, it prohibits "enduring offensive ground operations," but without defining them.</p>
<p>President Obama seems to want it both ways -- to oppose American participation in large-scale battles in Iraq, but to have the "flexibility" to order them; to prohibit ground operations but to have American troops in place to carry them out.</p>
<p>The administration thus appears to remain without an articulated strategy to prosecute the war IS launched against us, our allies and a broad range of civilian non-combatants.</p></blockquote>

The victims are Muslim, Christian (Nigerian Christians, Egyptian Copts beheaded in Libya, plus Yazidis, Chaldeans and 45 members of smaller sects in Iraq burned alive), and others (Japanese hostages and some who professed no religion). They are killed in places where governments have lost control of their territory to bands of increasingly well-armed Islamic radical forces.</p>

<p style="margin:0;">by <b>Khaled Abu Toameh</b> &nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp; February 18, 2015 at 5:00 am</p>

<blockquote class="content_preface" style="margin-top:0 !important;"><p>If Hamas has the resources to fund and arm a new "Liberation Army" consisting of 17,000 fighters, why does it continue to demand that the international community allocate billions of dollars for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip?</p>
<p>Hamas has turned the Gaza Strip into a huge training camp for jihadis and militiamen affiliated not only with it, but also with the Islamic State.</p>
<p>Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahar declared that some of the boys would be recruited to fire mortars and rockets at Israel. And of course, he reiterated Hamas's true goal, namely the destruction of Israel. When Hamas talks about "liberation," it means it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and replace it with an Islamic state.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, do not see Hamas's cynical exploitation and abuse of Palestinian children as a war crime.</p>
<p>If and when the International Criminal Court convenes to consider "war crimes" in the Middle East, the first thing the judges should consider is how Hamas sent thousands of Palestinian teenagers to their deaths, and, as this was happening, how Abbas and the Palestinian Authority looked the other way.</p></blockquote>

They were also "educated" about the need to eliminate Israel and "restore Palestinian rights."</p>

<p>Turkey's former top judge, Hasim Kilic, warned that Turkey's judiciary could become an "instrument of revenge" in the hands of political authorities. Understandably, he is a heartbroken man. He became a victim to his beliefs that Turkey's Islamists were defending civil liberties when they advocated more rights for the pious. He was too late in understanding that they were in fact defending the rights of Islamist Turks only.</p></blockquote>

His proclamation launched the most meaningful "aliyah" [going up to Israel] until modern times.[1]</p><p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 6px 0;">The Persian ruler even contributed treasure to help finance the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 6px 0;">There is, however, a different narrative. When Zoroastrianism was declared the official state religion during the Sassanid Dynasty (224-651 A.D.),[2] the plight of Iran's Jews deteriorated.</p><p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 6px 0;">This fusion of state and religion gave Zoroastrian clerics more political power than the monarchy. It also led to the enforcement of intolerant uniform rules of worship for all of Persia's citizenry.[3]</p>

They were not talking about any peace process with Israel. They were making statements that would only radicalize Palestinians and give them reason to hate Israel even more. They are leading their people toward eternal confrontation, and not reconciliation, with Israel.</p>
<p>The EU is not helping advance the cause of peace in the Middle East. On the contrary, the EU continues to turn a blind eye to the anti-Israel campaign, and is generously funding it through dozens of NGOs in the Palestinian territories.</p></blockquote>
