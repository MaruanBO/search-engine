              <p style="text-align: left;">“I had to write to thank you for your discovery when you developed Neuropathy as well as your Nerve Repair Optimizer! You deserve to be well rewarded for what you have done for mankind! It’s a shame that the society we live in today is geared towards the drug industry considering there is a lot more money to be made in drugs even though they don’t help at all. If anything, Wes, as you know already I’m sure, drugs never get to the root of the problems but only cover up symptoms. To top it off, drugs carry a long list of side affect as well.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Now your products of course are all natural and I am so glad I found your ads online when I had ordered it for my mother who was suffering severly from a severe stroke she encountered just last year. Her nervous system was shot from the stroke and on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst ever, she was continuously at an 11! No matter what these MD’s tried, whether it was various doses of drugs or pain patches, nothing helped. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">My mother never experienced such terrible pains and begged to get a shot that would end her misery. The MD’s had experimented with several dangerous drugs on my elderly 91 year old mother to see about getting rid of her pain. Needless to say, they did nothing for her except probably destroy her liver. I started her on just two of your capsules in the morning and two at night. I later added one of your Nerve Rpair Optimizers at night. Since she began your program in April, she went from an 11 all the way down to a 1 in August. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">It is now September and she seems to be getting better all the time. She still does have some pain when we move her left arm and leg that were paralyzed from the stroke but that’s only when we move her. We are hoping your products will take care of that as well. Please let me know what to expect as far as how much longer it will take before that pain disapears as well.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Once again Wes, we just want to thank you so much for everything you’ve done to help my mother with your wonderful products! Keep up the good work and God bless!”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I was diagnosed with CMT 1A (Chromosome 17) about two years ago. Nerve pain is so icky and very different from muscle pain. Very difficult to treat. I discovered Nerve Renew and began taking it about the same time I started triathlon training in an attempt to stave off leg braces (I was already requiring them on most days) and stiff hands and feet (Doctors are still on the fence as to whether endurance exercise is good for CMT or not).</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">About six weeks ago, I qualified for the USAT Paratriathlon National Championships. I am confident saying Nerve Renew is a huge part of my recipe for success. I would love to add the extra supplement to my regimen. The leg braces?  They are ugly reminders for me to remember taking my Nerve Renew  Fingers crossed &mdash; if all goes according to plan, I will send you another email when I qualify for USAT World Championships to be held in England in 2013…LET’S DO THIS!!!”</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">“January 7 I started on your support formula. I am almost pain free. I still feel the tightness and discomfort at times in my feet and legs. I am greatly improved on the excruciating pain and have not taken vicoden pills but three times in two months. Before it was at least every night or so. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I have recommended this to my gym friends who have also purchased the formula. I have had water therapy for balance as well as anodyn treament. However, I give most credit to your formula. My balance has improved, no cane, no holding husbands arm or need for grocery basket to lean on.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I am so thrilled to have found this formula. I have added several other supplements as well q10, multi and fish oil for heart, have bovine valve. I have Multiple Myloma, after 16 treatments, I am in remission, so at 87 in may I am in great shape. I sing, water exersise and therapy dance and live a wonderful life.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Thanks for your companies effort to heal people who have this peripheral neuropathy. I am gradually reducing other meds and may be able to stop it, it’s not doing much good that i can tell. Thanks”

Thank you so much. I have given this formula to my Chiropractor and neurologist who wanted to know the miracle formula for helping my pain.

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I’m writing to say….THANK YOU!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I really was afraid that I’d have to deal with this 24/7 misery for the rest of my life. I’m only 54 years old, and it was advancing rapidly.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I took my first two capsules on the evening of the day they arrived-May 17th, and exactly two months later on July 18th, I began to  notice that the stinging and burning was subsiding. I was so excited! It’s been very gradual, but it’s happening. The second thing I noticed was that the skin sensitivity on the tops and sides of my feet was gone.  I still have the numbness, especially in my toes, but I can move them more easily now. I do still have the occasional sharp pain, but it’s less and less also. Interestingly, it’s retreating in the opposite direction that it advanced. The tops and sides of my feet are improving first, and I imagine that my toes, where it started, will be the last to heal.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So you can add me to your long list of success stories! I didn’t know how I was going to deal with this condition; it was affecting all parts of my life. I’m so looking forward to having my feet feel normal again!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Again, thanks!”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“The history of my foot pain has stretched over a period of ten years. I went to several doctors, spending hundreds of dollars for office visits, shots in both feet, comfort soles, and shoes of all types. There was no lasting relief. The burning sensation, numbness, and tingling in both feet kept me dependent on over the counter drugs to get regular sleep.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The diagnosis was never clear until I got on the Web and searched for a remedy. The Neuropathy Treatment Group was the answer to my prayers. They supplied me with specific information in both what I read and in what the Group consultant provided me over the telephone. Within 24 hours upon receiving the support formula, I began to experience relief. It seemed unbelievable at first, but my relief continues after three months of usage.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I am a pastor who stands many hours weekly, and, yet, I am not distracted by foot pain while I speak or afterward. As a former college athlete, working out runs in my veins at sixty years of age, and I am enjoying the second wind of feeling so much better on my feet. So, the least I can do is to thank the Neuropathy Treatment Group for the research you’ve done to minimize my suffering and the hurt others suffer with Neuropathy.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I can not say enough for your formula. I have had Neuropathy of the legs for over ten years. In the beginning the Drs. Seemed to be interested in my pain and nothing else. The medication made me sleepy all of the time but did give some relief.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to my computer where I did research on Neuropathy and found that B vitamins were good for nerves among other things I found additional help. I presented my research to my Dr. And she started giving me B-12 shots once a month. I could tell by how my legs felt when a shot was due. When the B-12 was not enough once a month the Dr. Changed it to once every two weeks.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">About this time I did more research and found your product. It was just what I needed to support the B-12 shots. My legs feel good enough that I sometimes forget to go for my shot. In other words my legs do not bother me enough to let me know I need my shot. Your formula may not help some people but it does a good job for me.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I have had diabetic neuropathy of the truncel area for 10 years. It started occasionally but grew worse as the condition progressed. The last seven (7) years have been bad. I couldn’t work in 2005 and it put us in a terrible financial situation. The last three years have been very bad! The pain has been 24/7. The pain is in my stomach! </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">No doctors, even the Mayo doctor, could diagnose the problem, I went through 3 different doctors and three different complete work ups. I had a stroke in 2007 and a Neurologist diagnosed it as (Diabetic Truncel Neuropathy). He put me on 3600 mg of prescritpion drugs and I was on it for 4 years to no avail. I was on a 100 mcg of a different drug plus many different pain killers. I went through the 3 week Pain Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in July of this year to detox off of pain medications and to learn to deal with the pain with out pain killers.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The doctors at Mayo told me it would return to normal if I kept my blood sugar regulated. The Allina Doctor told me it would never go away.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">When I returned home from the PRC program I started to look on the internet for a solution! I found many claims and treatments. The one that stood out was the Neuropathy Treatment Groups solution. I ordered it and started the regiment about August 4th. It’s now September 20th and I’ve had 10 days with no pain! “It is a life changing event for me and my family.” I’m 70 years old and have the normal aches and pains for my age but I feel great!!!!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I talked with my pharmacist yesterday and she went over the ingredients with me she said the N.S.F. was not harmful with my medication or by it’s self.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I ordered another product but I never took more than a few doses over the last month or so because my pharmacist told me one of the main ingredients was poison in any form, leaves, roots or stems etc.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I am grateful to have found Nerve Renew (NSF) and the Nerve Optimizer and to be pain free. This result occurred four days after I started the treatment and it has now been 2 months and I remain pain free.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">When I found NSF, I was trying to find relief from the constant pain in both my feet which I had been experiencing for two years and which had been diagnosed as peripheral neuropathy. The pain included the feeling of a needle going into my toe, the entire bottom of my feet burning and feeling like I was walking on sandpaper or rocks and numbness &ndash; walking any distance became almost impossible. And to just put on socks or move my feet across a fold in my bed sheet was like a knife going into my feet. I became depressed because I had given up many of my chores and interests because nothing was worth increasing the constant pain by standing or walking.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Having been told by my primary care physician, two podiatrists, a neurologist, and an osteopath that there is little that could be done &ndash; I was discouraged. The physicians all prescribed the same things, none of which gave me the relief I have had from taking NSF. And, I didn’t want to “cover up” the pain with medication; I wanted the pain to end and to stop the deterioration of nerve cells.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">When I found ntg.wpengine.com, I looked up a couple of names from the testimonials and called to speak with them &ndash; the pain they had described was like mine. I was grateful to have first-hand confirmation of results and most of all to hear that there was hope. Next, I called the Neuropathy Treatment Group, and Shauna answered my questions and gave me helpful information. I am continuing to take NSF and the Nerve Optimizer &ndash; I don’t ever want to experience that pain again. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I keep printouts from the website with me, and I am on a mission to help others to try NSF &ndash; including giving information to my physicians so they can pass it onto their other patients. I am grateful about my pain being gone and being able to help others learn about Nerve Renew.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I just wanted you and your whole staff at Neuropathy Treatment Group to know that you have a wonderful product in your Neuropathy pills. As you know, my 90 year old mother had suffered a severe stroke back in September and along with it came severe nerve pains throughout her body. She had become paralyzed from the stroke on her left side and was in constant pain day and night. It wasn’t until she tried your Neuropathy pills starting in April that she finally started on her road to recovery.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The drugs the medical doctors put her on did nothing for her except cover up the symptoms while the underlying pain from the nerve damage was still there all along. Your product actually gets to the root of the problem and heals the damaged nerves which in turn automatically takes away the pain and needless suffering. Her acupuncturist is doing a wonderful job as well. Between your Neuropathy, the acupuncturist and the Stroke Mender she is on now, she will be back up and walking in no time even though her medical doctor insists she will never do so and must stay on a drug program for the rest of her life for pain control. There might be medical doctors out there who will learn something new from reading your articles and testimonies of all of your very satisfied users. Thanks a million!!!”

I have just finished my second bottle of Nerve Renew &amp; the first bottle of nerve repair optimizer. Hopefully the balance &amp; co-ordination will also improve meaningfully as I progress with the treatment. The burning sensation actually returned one night &ndash; after i had forgotten to take the pills. I got up at about 1 a.m. &amp; took 2 pills. After a couple of hours the burning sensation completely disappeared.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">The pain and discomfort in my upper right side was almost more than I could stand. I was trying everything but nothing helped. The pain was affecting my home life and my job. It was a constant stabbing, aching pain that would not go away. My skin had a burning sensation and I could not stand for clothes to touch my side.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In desparation, I told my husband I was going to try Nerve Renew, what could it hurt. I have been taking NSF for two weeks and I am pain free, something I thought would never happen. If you have neuropathy pain and are taking anything you can to stop the pain, you would be crazy not to try NSF. It has changed my life. NSF will be a staple in my diet for the rest of my life, I NEVER want to go through that pain again.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">“I have been using your Nerve Renew for some time now, and to put it in short it probably saved my life I have seen about six neurologists in the last four years to no avail, and it was a complete waste of time and money. About three years ago I tried your product but I didn’t have the patience. Then about a year ago I decided to give it a try again, and after about five months I started to get results I still have some burning and numbness in my feet, but it’s much better.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I have severe stenosis and had a bad bout of smoke inhalation, and disk degenerative disease plus there is a good chance that I had zinc poisoning from using poligrip for a top denture plate, because I got rear ended by a 18 wheeler and my upper teeth got smashed in. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I have some tips that you might want to pass on to some of your customers with huge problems like I had. The first thing I did was to buy a electric massager from walmart for $30.00, and then I got a script of cymbalta, and to top it off I got oxygen. In my case I have what they call polyneuropathy so I had severe pain in my back, hip, groin and lower legs and feet. This is common with people with diabetes. Another thing I recommend is to take a baby aspirin, and apply heat to the affected area. I believe my situation was worse than most folks so I did a lot of experimentation and research along with a bucket full of common sense.</p>

                  “When I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, I was scared to death! My Mom had PN, the burning kind, and was in much pain. The only help they knew to give her were strong pain pills that made her unaware of all surroundings. In fact, they tried  all kinds of medication to help her pain and very obviously did not know what they were treating her for and did not know what to try next.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So I started looking on the internet to see what it is all about and found there STILL are not many Doctors who REALLY know what PN is. The people I talked to said those EMG tests they give you are very painful and I do not want to do that.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Then I found the NERVE RENEW and tried that. In 9 short days of taking the formula, my feet started to feel alive again. (this is where it started to show up, in my feet). I could also feel it going up higher in my legs, in my shin bone area. I have high hopes, with starting this formula, I can stop the progression of this nasty illness taking over my body! My life already is more calm; I am not so anxious and do not think of my numbness and tingling all the time, because they feel so much better!”

                  “You are welcome to use my “testimonial”. I am 85 years old and I have had neuropathy since around 1994. I was never diagnosed at the time as having the disorder. My wife had suffered a series of severe strokes with multiple complications ultimately leading to her death and that required all of my attention.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I do not have diabetes which is a primary cause of neuropathy. Otherwise, as  you well know there are a hundred other causes for the disease. So usually when asked about my affliction I answer, “I do not know, and my doctor doesn’t know either.” I am numb, “dead,” with no feeling from my feet to my knees, in both legs. My arms and hands tingle, or are “asleep.” So the ailment has  progressed as predicted.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I investigated the internet and various therapies and devices that were recommended, from pills, herbs, sound, light, zone therapy, chiropractic, pressure points ad infinitum. When finally I decided to try your Nerve Renew (I am not sure exactly when I placed my first order), both feet were fire red. It was alarming to me and the medications only eased the discomfort and pain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I have faithfully taken the Support Formula and believe it or not, the redness in both feet has gradually disappeared and their color now matches other parts of my body!!!! Why? I don’t know the mechanism involved, but something has worked! I do not expect a reversal of the advances already made over the years by my neuropathy. I do not expect a cure. But I am grateful for the relief I have been experiencing by the use of your product.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">I would without a doubt recommend this treatment if you have burning, hot, sore feet. Smartest thing I’ve done in a long time. Thanks.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “I was a college pentathlete high jumping well over 6 ft, running sprints, hurdles, and relays. About 7 years ago, I started feeling a burning sensation around my toes, which turned to excruciating pain as it moved up my legs. There was no relief. 24 hours a day, asleep or awake, I was in intense pain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I had to plan how to walk across a room so as to not bump my feet into anything, or have one of my pets accidentally hit my feet. The pain was overwhelming. High heels were out of the question. My other joint alignment in my back and hips started to suffer. I fell sometimes because I couldn’t place my weight on my foot to walk without it buckling.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I consulted many specialist who performed excruciating tests on me. There observation? I must be in pain. Like I didn’t tell them that to begin with. None offered any treatment. None ever coordinated with the other doctors to come up with a plan.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I stumbled across this product, Nerve Renew 2 weeks ago while surfing the net to see if there might be any new news on the topic. I ordered and followed dosage directions. I can’t begin to tell you how depressed I had been facing every day of pain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I’d been going through it for so long, I didn’t realize how I dreaded each day. I’d forgot how wonderful it is to jump out of bed without pain. Several days after beginning to take this supplement, the condition started to retreat back down my legs. Within a week, I could align my feet and toes without discomfort. Now, two weeks into my new regimen with Nerve Renew, I’m eyeing new heels for New Years!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Be good to yourself! There IS hope! Try this. Life is too short to live in pain and immobility! I’ve experienced no side effects. In fact, whether it’s due to the lifting of depression and pain or just the main ingredients in Nerve Renew, I feel energized!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I’m very grateful to have found this product and will continue it as maintenance after the pain is completely gone. Thanks for making a huge change in my quality of life!”

I hurt all the time, I have even run out of pain pills, went to the hospital asked to have some pain med’s until Monday I would get my meds renewed, they called my main doctor and he said just send her home tell her we can not help.

But now I can get up, clean my house, get out of the house go walk and I do not hurt.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “In 1993 I was diagnosed with neuropathy. At that time there was little treatment for the pain. I began to lose strength, I experienced numbness in my hands and feet. I went to several different Neurologists through the years for some sort of help. Eventually I was given an assortment of several pain medications and anti-depressants. Nothing seemed to help.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In 2009 I was getting worse and diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Poly Neuropathy and  was put on IVIG treatments weekly along with standard neuropathy medication including narcotics for pain. I was experiencing severe chronic pain throughout my body, severe burning in feet, legs, hips, arms, and hands.  My body did not respond to the medical treatment I was given.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In January 2011 My DR. completely disabled me and stated my prognosis was poor. At this time I was in a wheel chair, or bed ridden. I was unable to help myself with the everyday tasks of life. At that time my daughter researched on the internet and found Neuropathy Treatment Group. March of 2011 she purchased two months of Nerve Renew. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Before I had finished the second month of taking Nerve Renew I began to see a change in pain and in strength. I continued to use Nerve Renew and by May 2011 I no longer needed the wheel chair. The pain had subsided drastically. I began to have strength and do normal everyday tasks.  On May 24th 2011 I was released back to work with only one restriction.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I have continued using Nerve Renew. I experience less pain than I have in the past. My strength is recovering more and more every day. I contribute Nerve Renew in giving me back my life from this horrible disease of neuropathy. I am not totally cured of this disease but I feel like I have been given back ten years or more.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Thank you Neuropathy Treatment Group”

              <p style="text-align: left;">I began taking the formula about 5 months ago after sending for the product. I noticed within 3 weeks fewer episodes of the painful burning and stinging. After three months, the awful pain was diminishing and although it is not entirely gone, the pain is so much more tolerable.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Added benefits that I have personally experienced include increased energy levels, better sleep and a sense of well being.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “Being a Lab Technician I recognize that usually to heal nerves, pain is involved.  Any surgeon will tell you this.  Most people though, have to go on toxic drugs to handle the pain while NSF furnishes their own pain reliever which works so much better than drugs, with the added benefit that it is a naturally occurring substance.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Just in the two months I have been taking the formula, my pain has receded from my legs and feet to just my toes now.  And I believe in another month or two it will be entirely gone.  This formula is well worth the money to be free of the pain of neuropathy. Join me in pain free days and nights but please don’t stop taking the formula because your pain seems to intensify at times.  That is the formula working to actually heal and stimulate the nerves themselves.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Please do yourself the favor of continuing for at least 4 months.  You must remember that the damage was not done overnight and it will not be healed overnight either. Like I said at the first, I am only two months into the formula but I can already feel a great difference in the amount of area in pain.  I truly believe you will too.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “I’m here to tell you that out of sheer desperation I was in search of something, anything that would put an end to the excruciating pain I was feeling in my legs. It all started with my the three last toes of my right foot. I began feeling a tingling, yet somewhat painful sensation. Within a week the pain had traveled to my ankle. By then I was having trouble standing let alone walking.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Within two more weeks the pain was now effecting my right knee, and every time I attempted to walk I would find myself losing my balance to the point that I was falling. After seeing a doctor for this condition I was diagnosed with diabetes and told that the symptoms were due to peripheral neuropathy. The worst part was that I was also told that it was going to get worse. When I walked out of my doctors office I was holding a wad of prescriptions that included medication to help relieve some of the pain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In the following weeks not only had the pain traveled to my right hip, it had started effecting my left leg as well. Within a month and a half, I was in so much pain that a simple touch of either leg would send me into a state of tears due to the pain. The pain at times was similar in feeling as if straight razorblades were cutting into my flesh, at other times it felt like thousands of needles piercing my skin all at the same time, and yet at other times it felt like electrical jolts were traveling through my legs. All in all, I was in so much pain that even after the doctors had doubled and tripled my pain medication nothing was working for me.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Then, within 3 months the doctor finally said that he was prescribing a wheelchair for me because he was predicting that within a couple of weeks I would have days where I would not be able to walk and would have to rely on a wheelchair.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">But it didn’t end there, he also told me to think about the long term effects of my neuropathy. He continued to say that the only way that I would be able to live a normal life without pain was to have both my legs amputated. Here I was a very active woman; not even in my mid fifties being told I would lose my legs. I was not only devastated, I was already beginning to slip into depression. He might as well of told me to go home, put my affairs in order because I’d be dead in a couple of weeks. At least that’s the way I was feeling. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Now I had to make a decision. Was the neuropathy going to do me in or was there something out there that could give me my life back. Well, I’m here to tell you that after all that I’ve been through and all the time and money I wasted on different supplements that stated that they could end the pain of neuropathy, I definitely found a formula that did and is still doing the job. When I found the Neuropathy Treatment Group, I figured I’ll give this company a try, I’ve tried so many others maybe this one is the one. Well, turns out the last one was the best one!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Immediately after I started using this formula I began to notice a change, the pain was subsiding. The more I used it the better I felt. I can honestly say I can sleep at night now and not have to put pillows in between my legs to keep them from touching one another. I can not only stand without loosing my balance, I can walk pain free.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In short, this formula is the best thing I have run across that can take anyone from the symptoms of neuropathy to being able to live a normal life again. I know it helped me for the greater good. Thank you, Neuropathy Treatment Group for giving me the opportunity to be me again!”

              <p style="text-align: left;">A friend and I took Nerve Renew for some troubling neuropathy problems. He has sharp stinging in his feet, and began to feel similar sensations in his hands, which were really bothering him. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I had troubling “cotton” feet sensations, very difficult to describe, but felt as if my feet were not fully grounded while walking, and later, my toes began to feel slightly numb.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Well, just after taking NERVE RENEW, within about two to three weeks, not even taking as much as suggested, I began to feel that there was some noticeable occasional improvements. It seemed it must be due to my imagination; or having a very strong placebo effect. Now just several more weeks later, my feet feel SO MUCH BETTER, barely noticeable problems, and my toes are no longer numb feeling! WOW, such nice relief!  </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I know that these improvements I have felt can no longer be a placebo effect!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">As for my friend, I asked him a couple days ago, “Do you still have sharp stinging pains in your feet and hands?”  He acted as if he NEVER had that problem! LOL He, too, had begun to notice some quick improvements just a few weeks after taking your product; and now, he has NO stinging toes and feet and hands!  This to me, is incredible and FANTASTIC!</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">There was no help from doctors when my friend approached them for help for another problem. One doctor suggested months ago, that he would likely need surgery for his then-troubling leg problems, so he began exercising more, taking long walks in a local nature park, taking some supplements, and just weeks later that problem finally resolved itself.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Too many doctors push surgery and very powerful drugs. </p>

Over the years it became worse and I began taking more and more of the meds to get relief from the symptoms.  Sitting and laying was painful for me, the only relief was standing, as any pressure on that leg caused a deep burning sensation. I had to take a pillow with me to sit on in our vehicles, school sports activities, lawn chairs, relaxing at home, and basically anywhere I went.

I Have not taken any kind of medicine, not even an aspirin. This hit me like a ton of bricks, my arms stiffened up and soon after I could hardly move. I Tried to sleep in a chair at night, because the minute I laid down, I couldn’t breathe. The good thing was that the black spot on my lung went away, but so did all my muscles.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I was unable to lift as much as cup. The Dr. gave me pain pills and steroid shots, it covered the pain, for a day. I won’t go into the miracle that I experienced through prayer, but then it hit my legs. I couldn’t walk from one room to the other without pain and my legs stiffening up. I Had chairs all over the place. I Was ready for a wheelchair, but refused, because I had made up my mind not to be an invalid.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Now I have been on the Support Formula 3 months and I can do so many things again. One problem, I have lost so much weight from these last 7 years, I went from 130 lbs. to 110 lbs. I Will be working on that next.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I thank God every day for finding The Neuropathy Treatment Group. Keep up the good work.”

                  “I am writing this on behalf of my 92 year old mother who I purchased your Nerve Renew for, because of Diabetic neuropathy that was causing her a lot of distress and which she had barely had any relief from, with the analgesics she was taking. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Well the great news is that from the second week she began to experience some relief and by a month the relief was significant and when I spoke to her on the phone yesterday after a month and a half, she was so happy I had ordered another 3 months supply for her, because she said she was experiencing amazing relief and couldn’t have been happier with the Support Formula.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So just wanted to say thanks so much!!!!! I am so happy my mothers quality of Life has been restored for these latter years of her life and she can walk and sleeps through the night now without pain.</p>

                  “I would like to give the following testimonial as seen from the wife of a man who has bravely survived 2 cancers without so much as one complaint and without missing work.  He is one of the most stoic and private people that I know.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">As the daughter of a physician, I have worked in the medical profession for 40 yrs. I thought that I had seen it all.  This neuropathy “thing” is insidious and relentless and can destroy a man.  The most disheartening part of the disease is that NO DOCTORS CARE or UNDERSTAND.  He has seen many specialists and I cannot tell you how many doctors have told him, “you just have to live with it.”  They conveniently do NOT SAY&mdash;-and your family will have to live with it too!!!  The morning I found him sitting in the basement (after no sleep &amp; obviously in pain),  I decided that this could not go on any longer or &ndash; knowing him, there would be a very bad end to things.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I got on my computer and searched all day for chat rooms, homeopathic cures, and anything else that I thought might offer a glimmer of help.  When I found the Neuropathy Treatment Group,  I immediately ordered it.  Being medically oriented it made sense.  It was not some “off the wall” sounding treatment.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">He has been on it about 3 wks now and I dare say, it is truly a miracle -and that is “knock on wood”.  HOPE is a good thing.  In the medical world HOPE is a great thing.  He has had this time free of symptoms,  and we are guardedly hopeful for future continued symptom free days.  He sleeps thru the night and wakes pain free. He does not dread going to bed knowing what the night will bring.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Thank you for offering me this format to try to help others.  This treatment works. I have checked his vitamin levels and continue to monitor his condition.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">HE BELIEVES, and I thank God and Neuropathy Treatment Group for saving my dear husband.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “I only received my  Nerve Renew on  February 24 and immediately started taking them that night. Not expecting to have any results ever, I have to add. The reason for my skepticism was that I am a chronic pain sufferer for over 20 years now and am currently on Morphine for 10 years. The medications and other remedies I’ve tried, apart from having have had 7 surgeries, will take up many pages would I have attempted to write them down.  There is not much I didn’t try, I can assure you of that.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I should probably mention my problem: About 22 years ago I had a minor knee-injury. My foot slipped while going up steps and I twisted my knee. Today I am permanently in a wheelchair and suffer chronic pain and have a knee that is “frozen” in a 90º position. This is a life-changing situation. Not only can I hardly function because of the pain, (mainly in the muscles), but it brought bladder problems, weight gain and ghastly swollen feet, ankles and calves into the equation. As the Morphine alone doesn’t help much anymore, I am taking a series of other medications as well and try new medications under supervision of my doctor all the time.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Just before the capsules arrived, my muscle-condition was at it’s worst ever. I could hardly move from my wheelchair onto the sofa or bed etc and I got really scared. Then the capsules came in the mail. For me they were just another bottle of stuff my husband ordered and that we would have to send back again. But, because of the severity of my pain I decided to give it an immediate try. To my astonishment they started to work 4 days later and a week later I was just about pain-free. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I still need to take the other medications and I have to treat the leg and any movements I make, with utter care and  consideration. But I no longer have to hold my knee when we go through bumps in the road or be scared of pain when my husband pushes me in the wheelchair and we go over joints in the sidewalks or strips in doorways, as this was how sensitive my muscles and probably then also the nerves in my leg became.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I would appreciate it if you could continue sending me these capsules.”

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                  “When I learned I had diabetes at age 72, I read what I could find on the Internet to try to treat the tingling I was experiencing in my toes. I ordered on-line, “Nerve Renew”, and later “Nerve Repair Optimizer”. My medical doctor told me, “Nerves in your toes and feet do not regenerate.” My education told me she was technically correct. But, I still wanted to try whatever I could find to stop the progression of discomfort, and then pain. Also, I seriously started losing weight (60 pounds so far, 50 to go) and cutting-out foods loaded with carbohydrates (cereals, bread, milk, etc). </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Diabetes apparently causes the blood vessels to gradually lose their ability to move blood to the toes, then feet, then legs. Maybe your “neuropathy pills” open the blood vessels that were collapsing from the diabetic condition, thereby feeding the tissues enough to stop the progressing loss of sensation. My toes and feet began to feel some normal sensations again. The pain was gone! The tingling in my toes and feet has disappeared. It is much easier to walk again.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I am just finishing my first bottle of “Nerve Renew”, along with the “Nerve Repair Optimizer” (R-Alpha Lipoic Acid). I still have some numbing in the bottom of my feet. If it doesn’t get any better, I’ll be happy. I’m hoping the treatment will be even more complete.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The neuropathy (tingling, numbing, then pain) was creeping-up, from my toes to my feet. I feared my feet would be painful for the rest of my life. I know what comes next, the legs.  I used to volunteer in a local hospital; I saw too many patients who had their toes, then feet and later their lower-legs surgically removed, because of their untreated diabetic conditions. How much better could their lives have been if they had tried “Nerve Renew” and “Nerve Repair Optimizer”.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Thank you for the dedication you applied to develop these medications for all.”

                  “I was diagnosed with neuropathy as a result of chemotherapy.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I received my Nerve Renew order on Jan. 21st and started the treatment with 2 caps daily on that same day. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">My oncologist had put me on meds on Jan. 6th so I was taking the Nerve Renew and other meds at the same time for about 10 days when I had to stop the other meds due to a bad skin rash. There had been no improvement at all in the numbness, tingling, and lack of balance. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">My doctor then switched me to another medication, so I kept on taking the 2 Neuropathy Support Caps and the other medication together for 12 days with no improvements whatsoever. I started having problems concentrating, eyesight was getting blurred and couldn’t get over the drowsiness.  Finally my doctor took me off the other medication and I asked him if I could just try Nerve Renew by itself to see if I could notice any improvement. He agreed.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I increased the dosage to 4 caps daily and I am so happy to tell you  that as of today (15 days after increasing the doses to 4 caps and not taking any other medication) my balance is getting pretty stable and the pain on my soles is still there but slowly diminishing.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">I’m sure that if I had started with 4 caps daily on Jan. 21 without the other medications, I would have have been further ahead by today.</p>

Within 7 days I could feel relief from the pain and a lessening of the coldness in my feet. I asked my primary physician during my next visit and he was so impressed with my symptom relief and the natural content after everything else had failed that he kept the empty bottles to share with his other patients suffering from neuropathy. I have also told many of my family members and acquaintances about the formula and they now take it with similar results. </p>

The doctors gave me prescription drugs and muscle relaxants, which they help some but I do not like the side effects.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So I looked around on the Internet and I came across Nerve Renew which was a vitamin formula, so first I thought what can vitamins really do. But I said what the hell, I’ll give them a try I’ve got nothing to lose. So I signed up for my free 14 day trial I did not notice anything during the 14 days, my doctor said could it take up to three months for vitamins to really take affect. So I took his advice and I stayed on Nerve Renew. I did start to notice a big difference after about two months. When I did not take them the pins and needles got worse. I also got feeling back in my feet and I can walk easier. With that said I got off medications and now only take Nerve Renew, With a few other vitamins.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So I would definitely advise anyone out there to give Nerve Renew a chance, what do you have to lose. It worked for me and it may just work for you.”

After x-stop surgery, it improved for a short time but eventually returned. In October, 2010, I fell and severely wounded my right leg, tearing a 5 x 5cm x1 piece out of the calf area of that leg. In the course of five months treatment at a wound center, vascular tests indicated peripheral artery disease. In the meantime the neuropathy grew increasingly worse. It was so intense that I could not go to sleep without some medication and then was awakened by burning and stabbing pain. I was supposed to keep my wounded leg elevated by day, but often could not do so because that aggravated the neuropathy. </p>

I was sent to a podiatrist who issued me an EMG, and a series of cortisone shots. It was the worst summer of my life. I could barely walk with all the soreness I had when I put shoes on. Without shoes, my feet were fine. After a series of cortisone shots, the quack of a podiatrist told me he was going to inject alcohol into the nerve to kill the nerve during my next treatment.That was the end of our relationship. The neurologist who did the EMG told me that this problem was retroactive, and the condition would improve over time. When I caught up with my personal doctor, he recommended I see a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. When I talked with the doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, he could not tell why the podiatrist ran me through the cortisone shots. I had all sorts of X-rays, and even a diabetes test. Nothing showed up positive. But still, the soreness lingered in my feet. I went through several pairs of shoes. I am on my feet all the time at work, on hard floors. After having been on your Vitamin B plan for several months, it has improved the vitality of my feet dramatically. The soreness has just about gone and I starting to get used to wearing sox and shoes once again without dreading that part of my life. Once again, Thanks…”

I am so thankful and grateful that I found you guys online and believing in you guys.

In fact, they tried  all kinds of medication to help her pain and very obviously did not know what they were treating her for and did not know what to try next.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">So I started looking on the internet to see what it is all about and found there STILL are not many Doctors who REALLY know what PN is. The people I talked to said those EMG tests they give you are very painful and I do not want to do that.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Then I found the NERVE RENEW and tried that. In 9 short days of taking the formula, my feet started to feel alive again. (this is where it started to show up, in my feet). I could also feel it going up higher in my legs, in my shin bone area. I have high hopes, with starting this formula, I can stop the progression of this nasty illness taking over my body! My life already is more calm; I am not so anxious and do not think of my numbness and tingling all the time, because they feel so much better!”

            neuropathy as well as other nerve related issues. The name change from

            effort to broaden visibility to those suffering from various other types of
            nerve aliments.

                      My name is Wes Jones, and I'm the president of the Neuropathy Treatment Group.
                      We specialize exclusively in the research of natural ways to reduce symptoms
                      related to all forms of neuropathy. in fact, we don't offer any product that
                      aren't related to relieving the symptoms of neuropathy. If you suffer from this
                      disease you'll want to hear how Michael Brady overcame his nerve pain after
                      10 years of suffering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Michael worked as a structural engineer until he had to retire because of the pain 
                      from walking that his job required. He eventually had to give up his active lifestyle. 
                      Michael had been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes years ago and had suffered from peripheral neuropathy for nearly 10 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>Neuropathy is commonly brought on by diabetes.</strong> And for Michael it all started many years ago with tingling and numbing
                      around his big toe and as time passed the numbing advanced to his other toes on both feet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      He didn't think much about it until he started experiencing pain and burning in
                      his feet. So that's when he went to see his doctor and found out that the pain and burning was caused from peripheral neuropathy. 
                      Many treatments and medications did not help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "<strong>You'll just have to live with it" was his doctor's diagnosis.</strong> All he could do for Michael was to prescribe pain medication, which he stayed on for years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      What's more, Michael hated how the pain killers made him feel, but if he wanted to function, 
                      he had no choice but to stay on them. Even worse, he lived with it for 10 years as the disease 
                      progressed to a point where he finally became desperate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>Michael turned to the internet and found that there were alternatives.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      He found that some people were getting relief from vitamin B shots. Others were 
                      using hot/cold packs but they were not getting the sustained relief that they were looking for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The medical community treats the condition with anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, steroid and cortisone injections, lidocaine patches and pain killers. They also use non-medicinal treatments such as electrical stimulation to the pain site and to the spine.
                      Doctors recognize the need for additional solutions to this wide spread, sometimes debilitating condition but their busy practices make it difficult to stay on top of the current nutritional research.

                  <p>
                      <strong>Michael found a doctor who treated his neuropathy with Vitamin B and Alpha Lipoic Acid shots. </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      He spent several months going into his office each week for the treatments, but they were costing him a fortune. And it was a pain getting in to see the Doctor every week, even though he was experiencing some relief.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      His doctor finally suggested that he find a good vitamin B supplement with high concentrations of Vitamin B-1, B-12 and Alpha Lipoic Acid. He felt that in order for the vitamin B to really have an effect, he needed to take it every day.
                      Michael ended up taking 4 different supplements to get the dosages he recommended but it was costing him over $100 a month and still not giving him satisfactory relief.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>Then one day while searching on the internet, he found the Nerve Renew. There is no other formula on the market like this.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      It contains the most powerful and clinically proven forms of B vitamins, Stabilized R Alpha Lipoic Acid, anti-oxidants and herbal extracts. All the ingredients have been clinically proven to reduce neuropathy pain and discomfort. And to Michaels delight, the Nerve Renew was less expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      He showed the ingredients to his doctor and he recommended that Michael continue using the product, as he was experiencing wonderful results. Plus, he started recommending Nerve Renew to his other patients.
                  </p>

                      <strong>Dear Neuropathy Treatment Group,</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After 10 years of suffering, thanks to you, I finally found an effective product. Now after months on the product, my neuropathy symptoms are almost gone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The tingling and numbness in my toes and legs are gone. I now have the ability to experience touch without pain. The feeling of cold and burning in my feet and legs is gone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I am off prescription pain medications and I no longer feel pain when my bare feet touch the carpet or rub on my sheets. I can even work around the yard again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      My wife and I are riding our bikes again, which I never thought would happen and I now have complete mobility. I have been able to return to my active lifestyle and I am even playing golf every week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I can't thank you enough for this life-changing product. I would recommend this amazing product to anyone suffering from nerve pain like I was.
                      Sincerely,
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="bigger">
                     3X greater bioavailability 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      To begin with, Nerve Renew is loaded with vitamin B. So are our competitors, but 
                      that's where the similarity between our formula and others ends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Many neuropathy supplements contain the common form of vitamin B1 called thiamine. The problem is that your body has a hard time absorbing thiamine. So when you take vitamin B1, you 
                      don't get all of the beneficial nutrients your body needs to relieve neuropathy pain. Much of it passes right out of your body in your urine, without doing you a bit of good.
                  </p>
                  <p class="bigger"> 
                     Instead of thiamine, Nerve Renew uses a form of vitamin B1 called benfotiamine. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      This molecule has a unique open-ring structure that enables benfotiamine to pass directly through cell membranes into the cell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      An important study in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology Therapy found that the bioavailability of benfotiamine is 3.6 X greater than thiamine hydrochloride.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      That means when you take Nerve Renew, you get more vitamin B delivered to your cells where
                      it's needed.
                       With benfotiamine, the sustained increase of Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP) can produce beneficial effects on general nerve health, neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, polyneuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, 
                       and coronary health for diabetics and non-diabetics alike.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In addition, benfotiamine is less toxic than thiamine hydrochloride. And after decades of use by millions of people, there have been no adverse affects reported related to the use of vitamin B-1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There is minimal to nil downside in trying benfotiamine and the individual results have the potential to be quite significant.
                      The daily dose of Nerve Renew contains 600mg with a 27,500% daily value rating established by the FDA. And,
                      it's fast-acting: a German study found that benfotiamine can relieve neuropathy pain within 3 weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p class="bigger">
                      Plus, Nerve Renew also contains another potent B vitamin, B12 or methylcobalamine.
                  </p>
                  <img src="http://4cnhcy85iru3or27y5v439zq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/socrates/images/formula2.png" class="formula2" alt="" />
                  <p>
                      <strong>Methylcobalamine</strong> is absorbed and used more efficiently than cyanocobalamine, the more common form of vitamin B12 found in most supplements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      A study in the Journal of Neurological Science postulated that methylcobalamine could increase protein synthesis and help regenerate nerves. <strong>Scientists state that ultra-high doses of methylcobalamine have been shown in clinical studies to produce nerve regeneration.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, taking this important vitamin in the right dosage may result in the growth of new nerve cells in your body! The daily dose of our formula contains 4000mcg B12 with a 66,664% daily value rating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>These special forms of vitamin B are effective, but 100% Stabilized R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (R-ALA) is key to significant reduction of neuropathy and nerve pain.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <img src="http://4cnhcy85iru3or27y5v439zq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/socrates/images/formula3.png" class="formula3" alt="" />
                  <p>
                      <strong>R-Alpha Lipoic Acid</strong> is a potent antioxidant that is both fat and
                      water soluble, which improves the function of cell "transporters" that carry and
                      distribute glucose. R-ALA is also one of the few substances that can cross the blood/brain barrier to enter the brain and go directly where it is needed most. Most importantly, R-ALA is the only antioxidant that has the unique ability to regenerate itself and other 
                      antioxidants such as B vitamins. Many studies, doctors and researchers have shown Stabilized R-ALA to be up to 12 times as effective as the cheaper S-ALA found in most common Alpha Lipoic Acid supplements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      R-ALA also has a specific effect on nerves, which has been shown to ease the burning, pain, and numbness associated with neuropathy. It promotes better blood flow and oxygen to the nerves. It also promotes the entry of glucose and the breakdown of it into cells.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                      Sometimes referred to as "super antioxidant", R-ALA can regenerate other antioxidants
                      (e.g., B vitamins), combating free radicals which are a primary cause of nerve damage. 
                      The daily value rating has not been established by the FDA.

                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Because I have always been a very physically active person, I was quite distressed and perplexed at the onset of 
                              constant burning, tingling, and numbness in my feet and calves about a year and a half ago. After working my way 
                              through about 8 different doctors including 3 neurologists at major hospitals in Pittsburgh, I was diagnosed with 
                              small fiber neuropathy, possibly related to common variable immune deficiency. Many treatments and medications did not help.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Thankfully, I tried Nerve Renew. This has been a major factor in dramatically decreasing the burning and numbness 
                              that was affecting me day and night. I had practically given up on being able to wear shoes and do the hiking and bicycling I 
                              had previously enjoyed so much.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Thanks to Nerve Renew, I am beginning to enjoy my active life again. I am especially looking forward to cross country 
                              skiing this winter!

                              it was time for me to take control, read all I could find and try for other solutions. Rather than sit
                              around waiting to get worse I would try taking nutritional supplements and increase my 
                              vitamins, minerals and intake of fruits & vegetables that were recommended.

                              feeling in my feet. The tops don't feel as rigid as they have for a couple years! I can't believe there 
                              can be such quick response after taking 28 capsules. I will need a new supply and hope to feel

                              ago. To my amazement, 7 days after starting using it, I noticed extreme improvement of the
                              great discomfort of neuropathy caused by diabetes and multiple sclerosis. I had been feeling
                              something I call "hyper sensitivity" for about 8 months. I couldn't stand anything touching the 
                              area where the symptoms were occurring, mainly my feet and sometimes my hands. While
                              trying to go to sleep, any type of cover I tried to cover myself with would touch the affected area 
                              and I felt like jumping out of my skin. Then this "hyper sensitivity" turned into major needle 
                              pricking sensation in my toes mostly. My doctor prescribed medications, but I received very little 
                              help from it. Thank you for making this wonderful product!"

                              "I  was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in February of 2011, at that time it was hard to walk and I was feeling severe pain in my back and chest, I also had pins and needles from the chest down. The doctors gave me medications and muscle relaxants, which they help some but I do not like the side effects of some prescription drugs.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              So I looked around on the Internet and I came across Nerve Renew which was a vitamin formula, so first I thought what can vitamins really do. But I said what the hell, I'll give them a try I've got nothing to lose. So I signed up for my free 14 day trial I did not notice anything during the 14 days, my doctor said could it take up to three months for vitamins to really take affect. So I took his advice and I stayed on Nerve Renew. I did start to notice a big difference after about two months. When I did not take them the pins and needles got worse. I also got feeling back in my feet and I can walk easier. With that said I got off medications and now only take Nerve Renew, with a few other vitamins.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              So I would definitely advise anyone out there to give Nerve Renew a chance, what do you have to lose. It worked for me and it may just work for you."

                        The most common B12 used in supplements is called Cyanocobalamine (Cobalamine). The body must convert Cobalamine to Methylcobalamine in order to get adequate
                        levels of Methyl B12 into the blood system. As the body gets older, it loses its ability to convert Cobalamine to Methylcobalamine and the body
                        absorb as little as 1% of the amount taken.
                        <br />
                        Methylcobalamine is the form of vitamin B12 that can be directly utilized by the body and is easily absorbed.
                        It is now available in our proprietary blend.

                        Benfotiamine is a new type of vitamin B1. It is fat-soluble unlike Thiamine B1 which is water soluble.
                        The result is that Benfotiamine can dramatically increase the levels of B1 in the blood stream, and effectively
                        decrease or eliminate the symptoms of neuropathy.
                        <br />
                        Studies have shown Benfotiamine to be absorbed 360% better than other, more common, forms of vitamin B1.

                        Several Clinical Trials have shown that R-Alpha Lipoic Acid can have a very positive effect on sufferers of Neuropathy. R-ALA has been shown
                        to be up to 12 times more effective the the cheaper and more common S-Alpha Lipoic Acid.
                        Neuropathy Treatment Group ONLY uses stabilized R-ALA because of its superior efficacy and absorbability compared to the common S-ALA found
                        in most supplements. Stabilized R-ALA is also able to withstand temperatures above 90 degrees fahrenheit (like in the back of a mail truck)
                        without hardening into an unusable product.
                        Doctors have made the following statements about the effects of alpha-lipoic acid on neuropathy: (full excerpts can be found on our “clinical studies” page)

                          Seven men and four women with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy were treated with methylcobalamine (2,500 micrograms in 10 ml of saline) injected intrathecally. Treatment was begun when patients had good metabolic control, as determined by measurements of plasma glucose and hemoglobin, and was repeated several times with a one-month interval between injections. Three patients were re-treated one year after the last intrathecal injection. <strong>Symptoms in the legs, such as paresthesia, burning pains, and heaviness, dramatically improved</strong>. The effect appeared within a few hours to one week and lasted from several months to four years. The mean peroneal motor-nerve conduction velocity did not change significantly. The mean (+/- SD) concentration of methylcobalamin in spinal fluid was 114 +/- 32 pg/ml before intrathecal injection (n = 5) and 4,752 +/- 2,504 pg/ml one month after intrathecal methylcobalamin treatment (n = 11). <strong>Methylcobalamine caused no side effects</strong> with respect to subjective symptoms or characteristics of spinal fluid. These findings suggest that a high concentration of methylcobalamin in spinal fluid is <strong>highly effective and safe for treating the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy</strong>.

                          Despite intensive searches for therapeutic agents, few substances have been convincingly shown to enhance nerve regeneration in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Recent biochemical evidence suggests that an ultra-high dose of methylcobalamin (methyl-B12) may up-regulate gene transcription and thereby protein synthesis. We examined the effects of ultra-high dose of methyl-B12 on the rate of nerve regeneration in rats with acrylamide neuropathy, using the amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) after tibial nerve stimulation as an index of the number of regenerating motor fibers. After intoxication with acrylamide, all the rats showed equally decreased CMAP amplitudes. The animals were then divided into 3 groups; rats treated with ultra-high (500 micrograms/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) and low (50 micrograms/kg) doses of methyl- B12, and saline-treated control rats. <strong>Those treated with ultra-high dose showed significantly faster CMAP recovery</strong> than saline-treated control rats, whereas the low-dose group showed no difference from the control. Morphometric analysis revealed a similar difference in fiber density between these groups. <strong>Ultra-high doses of methyl-B12 may be of clinical use for patients with peripheral neuropathies</strong>.

GAD mice received orally methyl-B12 (1 mg/kg body wt/day) from the 40th day after birth for 25 days. In the distal endplate zone of the muscle, although most terminals were degenerated in both the untreated and methyl-B12-treated GAD mice, sprouts were more frequently observed in the latter. In the proximal endplate zone, where few degenerated terminals were seen in both groups of the mice, the perimeter of the terminals was increased and the area of the terminals was decreased significantly in the methyl-B12-treated GAD mice. <strong>These findings indicate that methyl-B12 promotes regeneration of degenerating nerve terminals</strong> in GAD mice.

                          <strong>Purpose:</strong> To examine the effects of methylcobalamine on glutamate- induced neurotoxicity in the cultured retinal neurons. Methods: Primary cultures obtained from the fetal rat retina (gestation days 16 to 19) were used for the experiment. The neurotoxicity was assessed quantitatively using the trypan blue exclusion method. Results: Glutamate neurotoxicity was prevented by chronic exposure to methylcobalamine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), which is formed in the metabolic pathway of methylcobalamin. Chronic exposure to methylcobalamine and SAMe also inhibited the neurotoxicity induced by sodium nitroprusside that release nitric oxide. By contrast, acute exposure to methylcobalamine did not protect retinal neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity. Conclusions: <strong>Chronic administration of methylcobalamine protects cultured retinal neurons</strong> against N-methyl-D- aspartate-receptor-mediated glutamate neurotoxicity, probably by altering the membrane properties through SAMe-mediated methylation.

                          The effects of methylcobalamin, a vitamin B12 analogue, on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were examined using cultured rat cortical neurons. Cell viability was markedly reduced by a brief exposure to glutamate followed by incubation with glutamate-free medium for 1 h. Glutamate cytotoxicity was prevented when the cultures were maintained in methylcobalamin-containing medium. Glutamate cytotoxicity was also prevented by chronic exposure to S-adenosylmethionine, which is formed in the metabolic pathway of methylcobalamin. Chronic exposure to methylcobalamin and S- adenosylmethionine also inhibited the cytotoxicity induced by methyl-D-aspartate or sodium nitroprusside that releases nitric oxide. In cultures maintained in a standard medium, glutamate cytotoxicity was not affected by adding methylcobalamin to the glutamate-containing medium. In contrast, acute exposure to MK-801, a NMDA receptor antagonist, prevented glutamate cytotoxicity. These results indicate that <strong>chronic exposure to methylcobalamin protects cortical neurons</strong> against NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity.

                          The therapeutic effectiveness of a benfotiamine (CAS 22457-89-2)-vitamin B combination (Milgamma-N), administered in high (4 x 2 capsules/day, = 320 mg benfotiamine/day) and medium doses (3 x 1 capsules/day), was compared to a monotherapy with benfotiamine (Benfogamma) (3 x 1 tablets/day, = 150 mg benfotiamine/day) in diabetic patients suffering from painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy (DNP). In a 6-week open clinical trial, 36 patients (aged 40 to 70 yrs) having acceptable metabolic control (HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) were randomly assigned to three groups, each of them comprising 12 participants. Neuropathy was assessed by five parameters: the pain sensation (evaluated by a modified analogue visual scale), the vibration sensation (measured with a tuning fork using the Riedel-Seyfert method) and the current perception threshold (CPT) on the peroneal nerve at 3 frequencies: 5, 250 and 2000 Hz). Parameters were registered at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 3rd and 6th week of therapy. <strong>An overall beneficial therapeutic effect on the neuropathy status was observed in all three groups during the study, and a significant improvement in most of the parameters studied appeared already at the 3rd week of therapy</strong> (p &lt; 0.01). The greatest change occurred in the group of patients receiving the high dose of benfotiamine (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05, resp., compared to the other groups). Metabolic control did not change over the study. It is concluded that benfotiamine is most effective in large doses, although even in smaller daily dosages, either in combination or in monotherapy, it is effective.

The <strong>results showed a significant improvement (p = 0.006) of nerve conduction velocity</strong> in the peroneal nerve and a statistical trend toward improvement of the vibration perception threshold. Long-term observation of 9 patients with verum over a period of 9 months support the results. Therapy-specific <strong>adverse effects were not seen</strong>.

                          We have demonstrated previously that intracellular formation of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) N-[Epsilon]-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) inversely correlates with diabetic vascular complications independently from glycemia (Diabetologia 42, 603, 1999). Here, we studied the effect of benfotiamine, a lipid-soluble thiamine derivative with known AGE-inhibiting properties in-vitro on the intracellular formation of (CML) and methylglyoxal-derived AGE in red blood cells. Blood was collected from 6 Type 1 diabetic patients (2m, 4f, age 31.8 ± 5.5 years; diabetes duration 15.3 ± 7.0 years) before and after treatment with 600 mg/day benfotiamine for 28 days. In addition to HbA1c (HPLC), CML and methylglyoxal were measured using specific antibodies and a quantitative blot technique. While treatment with benfotiamine did not affect HbA1c levels (at entry: 7.18 ± 0.86%; at conclusion 6.88 ± 0.88%; p not significant), levels of CML decreased by 40% (737 ± 51 arbitrary units/mg protein (AU) vs 470 ± 86 AU; p&lt;0.01). <strong>The levels of intracellular methylglyoxal were reduced by almost 70%</strong> (1628 ± AU vs 500 ± 343 AU; p&lt;0.01). The data indicate that thiamine derivatives are effective inhibitors of both intracellular glycoxidation and AGE formation.

In this study, benfotiamine was shown to inhibit (AGE) development which in turn leads to decresed risk for these diseases.

We have discovered that the lipid-soluble thiamine derivative benfotiamine can inhibit these three pathways, as well as hyperglycemia-associated NF-kappaB activation, by activating the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme transketolase, which converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate into pentose-5-phosphates and other sugars. In retinas of diabetic animals, benfotiamine treatment inhibited these three pathways and NF-kappaB activation by activating transketolase, and also prevented experimental diabetic retinopathy. The ability of benfotiamine to inhibit three major pathways simultaneously might be clinically useful in preventing the development and progression of diabetic complications.

                          <strong>Summary:</strong>Advanced glycation end product (AGE) has been linked to many age related illnesses such as cataract development, Alzheimer’s Disease, cardiovascular disease, strokes and reduced muscle function. In this study, benfotiamine was shown to inhibit (AGE) development which in turn leads to decresed risk for these diseases.

                          Experimentally-induced diabetes of the dog leads to disturbances in the autonomous neurological function of the heart after approximately 3 months of continuously- observed diabetes. As signs of autonomic cardiac neuropathy, the heart rate variability and Valsalva ratio clearly fell in the untreated diabetic animals. Oral benfotiamine, administered from the sixth day after diabetes-induction, prevented or at least delayed these changes. According to the results, <strong>treatment with fat-soluble benfotiamine can play an important role in the therapy and prevention of cardiac autonomic neuropathy</strong>, apart from any effect on diabetic metabolic disturbances.

                          <strong>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:</strong> In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 181 diabetic patients in Russia and Israel received once-daily oral doses of 600 mg (n = 45) (ALA600), 1,200 mg (n = 47) (ALA1200), and 1,800 mg (ALA1800) of ALA (n = 46) or placebo (n = 43) for 5 weeks after a 1-week placebo run-in period. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline of the Total Symptom Score (TSS), including stabbing pain, burning pain, paresthesia, and asleep numbness of the feet. Secondary end points included individual symptoms of TSS, Neuropathy Symptoms and Change (NSC) score, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), and patients’ global assessment of efficacy.

                      <p>
                          <strong>RESULTS:</strong> Mean TSS did not differ significantly at baseline among the treatment groups and on average decreased by 4.9 points (51%) in ALA600, 4.5 (48%) in ALA1200, and 4.7 (52%) in ALA1800 compared with 2.9 points (32%) in the placebo group (all P &lt; 0.05 vs. placebo). The corresponding response rates (&gt;/=50% reduction in TSS) were 62, 50, 56, and 26%, respectively. Significant improvements favoring all three ALA groups were also noted for stabbing and burning pain, the NSC score, and the patients’ global assessment of efficacy. The NIS was numerically reduced. Safety analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in nausea, vomiting, and vertigo.

                          Antioxidant treatment has been shown to prevent nerve dysfunction in experimental diabetes, providing a rationale for a potential therapeutic value in diabetic patients. The effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid) were studied in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials. In the Alpha-Lipoic Acid in Diabetic Neuropathy Study, 328 patients with NIDDM and symptomatic peripheral neuropathy were randomly assigned to treatment with intravenous infusion of alpha-lipoic acid using three doses (ALA 1,200 mg; 600 mg; 100 mg) or placebo (PLAC) over 3 weeks. The total symptom score (TSS) (pain, burning, paresthesia, and numbness) in the feet decreased significantly from baseline to day 19 in ALA 1,200 and ALA 600 vs. PLAC. Each of the four individual symptom scores was significantly lower in ALA 600 than in PLAC after 19 days (all P &lt; 0.05). The total scale of the Hamburg Pain Adjective List (HPAL) was significantly reduced in ALA 1,200 and ALA 600 compared with PLAC after 19 days (both P &lt; 0.05). In the Deutsche Kardiale Autonome Neuropathie Studie, patients with NIDDM and cardiac autonomic neuropathy diagnosed by reduced heart rate variability were randomly assigned to treatment with a daily oral dose of 800 mg alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) (n = 39) or placebo (n = 34) for 4 months. Two out of four parameters of heart rate variability at rest were significantly improved in ALA compared with placebo. A trend toward a favorable effect of ALA was noted for the remaining two indexes. In both studies, no significant adverse events were observed. In conclusion, intravenous treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg/day) over 3 weeks is safe and effective in reducing symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and oral treatment with 800 mg/day for 4 months may improve cardiac autonomic dysfunction in NIDDM.

                          <strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>&ndash;To determine whether lipoic acid (LA) will reduce oxidative stress in diabetic peripheral nerves and improve neuropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&ndash;We used the model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy (SDN) and evaluated the efficacy of LA supplementation in improving nerve blood flow (NBF), electrophysiology, and indexes of oxidative stress in peripheral nerves affected by SDN, at 1 month after onset of diabetes and in age-matched control rats. LA, in doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg/kg, was administered intraperitoneally five times per week after onset of diabetes. RESULTS&ndash;NBF in SDN was reduced by 50%; LA did not affect the NBF of normal nerves but improved that of SDN in a dose-dependent manner. After 1 month of treatment, LA-supplemented rats (100 mg/kg) exhibited normal NBF. The most sensitive and reliable indicator of oxidative stress was reduction in reduced glutathione, which was significantly reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and alpha-tocopherol-deficient nerves; it was improved in a dose-dependent manner in LA-supplemented rats. The conduction velocity of the digital nerve was reduced in SDN and was significantly improved by LA. CONCLUSIONS&ndash;These studies suggest that LA improves SDN, in significant part by reducing the effects of oxidative stress. The drug may have potential in the treatment of human diabetic neuropathy.

                          Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, are powerful antioxidants. LA scavenges hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrite, and singlet oxygen. Dihydrolipoic acid also scavenges superoxide and peroxyl radicals and can regenerate thioredoxin, vitamin C, and glutathione, which in turn can recycle vitamin E. There are several possible sources of oxidative stress in diabetes including glycation reactions, decompartmentalization of transition metals, and a shift in the reduced-oxygen status of the diabetic cells. Diabetics have increased levels of lipid hydroperoxides, DNA adducts, and protein carbonyls. Available data strongly suggest that LA, because of its antioxidant properties, is particularly suited to the prevention and/or treatment of diabetic complications that arise from an overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In addition to its antioxidant properties, LA increases glucose uptake through recruitment of the glucose transporter-4 to plasma membranes, a mechanism that is shared with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Further, recent trials have demonstrated that LA improves glucose disposal in patients with type II diabetes. In experimental and clinical studies, LA markedly reduced the symptoms of diabetic pathologies, including cataract formation, vascular damage, and polyneuropathy. To develop a better understanding of the preventative and therapeutic potentials of LA, much of the current interest is focused on elucidating its molecular mechanisms in redox dependent gene expression.

                          Diabetic neuropathy represents a major health problem, as it is responsible for substantial morbidity, increased mortality, and impaired quality of life. Near-normoglycaemia is now generally accepted as the primary approach to prevention of diabetic neuropathy, but is not achievable in a considerable number of patients. In the past two decades several medical treatments that exert their effects despite hyperglycaemia have been derived from the experimental pathogenetic concepts of diabetic neuropathy. Such compounds have been designed to improve or slow the progression of the neuropathic process and are being evaluated in clinical trials, but with the exception of alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid) which is available in Germany, none of these drugs is currently available in clinical practice. Here we review the current evidence from the clinical trials that assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of thioctic acid in diabetic polyneuropathy. Thus far, 15 clinical trials have been completed using different study designs, durations of treatment, doses, sample sizes, and patient populations. Within this variety of clinical trials, those with beneficial effects of thioctic acid on either neuropathic symptoms and deficits due to polyneuropathy or reduced heart rate variability resulting from cardiac autonomic neuropathy used doses of at least 600 mg per day. The following conclusions can be drawn from the recent controlled clinical trials. 1.) Short-term treatment for 3 weeks using 600 mg of thioctic acid i.v. per day appears to reduce the chief symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy. A 3-week pilot study of 1800 mg per day given orally indicates that the therapeutic effect may be independent of the route of administration, but this needs to be confirmed in a larger sample size. 2.) The effect on symptoms is accompanied by an improvement of neuropathic deficits. 3.) Oral treatment for 4-7 months tends to reduce neuropathic deficits and improves cardiac autonomic neuropathy. 4.) Preliminary data over 2 years indicate possible long-term improvement in motor and sensory nerve conduction in the lower limbs. 5.) Clinical and postmarketing surveillance studies have revealed a highly favourable safety profile of the drug. Based on these findings, a pivotal long-term multicenter trial of oral treatment with thioctic acid (NATHAN I Study) is being conducted in North America and Europe aimed at slowing the progression of diabetic polyneuropathy using a clinically meaningful and reliable primary outcome measure that combines clinical and neurophysiological assessment.

                          Antioxidants, in particular vitamin E (VE), have been reported to protect against diabetic renal injury. alpha-Lipoic acid (LA) has been found to attenuate diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but its effects on nephropathy have not been examined. In the present study, parameters of glomerular injury were examined in streptozotocin diabetic rats after 2 mo on unsupplemented diets and in diabetic rats that received the lowest daily dose of dietary LA (30 mg/kg body wt), VE (100 IU/kg body wt), or vitamin C (VC; 1 g/kg body wt), which detectably increased the renal cortical content of each antioxidant. Blood glucose values did not differ among the diabetic groups. At 2 mo, inulin clearance, urinary albumin excretion, fractional albumin clearance, glomerular volume, and glomerular content of immunoreactive transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and collagen alpha1 (IV) all were significantly increased in unsupplemented D compared with age-matched nondiabetic controls. With the exception of inulin clearance, LA prevented or significantly attenuated the increase in all of these glomerular parameters in D, as well as the increases in renal tubular cell TGF-beta seen in D. At the dose used, VE reduced inulin clearance in D to control levels but failed to alter any of the other indices of glomerular injury or to suppress renal tubular cell TGF-beta in D. VC suppressed urinary albumin excretion, fractional albumin clearance, and glomerular volume but not glomerular or tubular TGF-beta or glomerular collagen alpha1 (IV) content. LA but not VE or VC significantly increased renal cortical glutathione content in D. These data indicate that LA is effective in the prevention of early diabetic glomerular injury and suggest that this agent may have advantages over high doses of either VE or VC.</p>

                          In the past decade or so, a convincing link between oxidative stress and degenerative conditions has been made and with the knowledge that oxidatiye changes may actually trigger deterioration in cell function, a great deal of energy has focussed on identifying agents which may have possible therapeutic value in combating oxidative changes. One agent which has received attention, because of its powerful antioxidative effects, particularly in neuronal tissue, is lipoic acid.

The present study examined the effects of chronic LA supplementation (30 mg/kg body wt per d) on nephropathy in D after 7 mo of diabetes. Compared with control rats, D developed increased urinary excretion of albumin and transforming growth factor beta, renal insufficiency, glomerular mesangial matrix expansion, and glomerulosclerosis in association with depletion of glutathione and accumulation of malondialdehyde in renal cortex. LA prevented or ameliorated all of these changes in D. Because chronic LA supplementation also attenuated hyperglycemia in D after 3 mo, its effects on renal injury were compared with treatment of rats with sufficient insulin to maintain a level of glycemic control for the entire 7-mo period (D-INS) equivalent to that observed with LA during the final 4 mo. Despite superior longitudinal glycemic control in D-INS, urinary excretion of albumin and transforming growth factor beta, glomerular mesangial matrix expansion, the extent of glomerulosclerosis, and renal cortical malondialdehyde content were all significantly greater, whereas cortical glutathione content was lower than corresponding values in D given LA. Thus, the renoprotective effects of LA in D were not attributable to improved glycemic control alone but also likely reflected its antioxidant activity. The combined antioxidant and hypoglycemic actions of LA both may contribute to its utility in preventing renal injury and other complications of diabetes.

                          <strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The diabetic state, in both humans and experimental animals, is associated with oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation of nerve membranes has been suggested as a mechanism by which peripheral nerve ischemia and hypoxia could cause neuropathy. Lipoic acid (LA) is a powerful inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species. The treatment of diabetic peripheral and cardiac autonomic neuropathy with LA is based on good clinical and experimental evidence.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> To investigate the magnitude of the oxidative stress, serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) and lipid peroxide (Lp) levels were measured in 10 patients with diabetic neuropathy, before and 70 days after treatment with single dose of 600 mg LA/day. For other 12 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects the serum Cp and Lp levels were evaluated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>RESULTS:</strong> Our results show that hyperglycemia is a factor for an increase in serum ceruloplasmin in patients with diabetic neuropathy compared to healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). High serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) level in patients with diabetes may be related to antioxidant defense. The treatment of diabetic neuropathy with LA does not affect significantly the serum Cp activity. The serum Lp levels after LA administration were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.005) than those before treatment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The antioxidant therapy with R-ALA improves and may prevent diabetic neuropathy. This improvement is associated with a reduction in the indexes of lipid peroxidation. Oxidative stress appears to be primarily due to the processes of nerve ischemia and hyperglycemia autooxidation.
