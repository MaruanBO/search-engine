Ron Hubbard's belief that humans are inhabited by the tormented spirits of a distant civilization -- and what it takes to cast them out.\n\nBased on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Lawrence Wright's book and featuring testimonials from eight former Scientology members, Going Clear was originally scheduled to debut on HBO on March 16, but the film will now be released Sunday, March 29 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

These vector-borne diseases continue to have a major impact on human health in the developing world: each year, more than a billion people become infected and around a million people die. In addition, around one in six cases of illness and disability worldwide arise from these diseases.\n\nMalaria arguably continues to attract the most attention of all the vector-borne diseases by virtue of causing the greatest global disease burden. However, others such as dengue are not only resurgent in some regions, but threaten a vast proportion of the world's population.\n\nClimate change remains a substantial threat to future human health and since the behaviour of disease carriers like mosquitoes is known to be extremely sensitive to temperature and rainfall, it seems unquestionable that climate change will affect many, if not all, of these diseases. What is less clear, however, is the extent to which climate increases the risk of becoming infected in certain regions compared to other factors such as poverty or fragile health systems.\n\nIn addition, although the number of new cases of diseases such as malaria appears to be declining worldwide, it is still increasing in many regions for a variety of reasons; the continued spread of insecticide resistance, changes in land use, and difficulties in maintaining political interest pose considerable challenges. Which of these factors will be most influential over the coming decades remains up for debate and one that was raised in a special edition of Philosophical Transactions B.\n\nChanges in risk\n\nThe latest research, however, is clear and consistent in many of its findings. Different diseases, transmitted by different vectors, respond in different ways to changing weather and climate patterns. Climate change is very likely to favour an increase in the number of dengue cases worldwide, while many important mosquito populations that are able to transmit devastating diseases are changing in their distribution.\n\nThe latest maps show that many areas of Europe (including the UK) could become increasingly hospitable for mosquitoes that transmit dengue over the coming decades (the map below shows a projected change in suitable habitat for the Aedes albopictus mosquito). Similarly, other mosquito range expansions are likely to occur in the US and eastern Asia. If dengue and/or chikungunya are imported into these regions, there will be a considerable increase in the worldwide number of vulnerable individuals.\n\nIt is also clear that small changes in these so-called risk maps can have very large public health impacts. Tick-borne diseases (such as Lyme disease) are also predicted to expand in range as climate changes. Although, as before, plenty of other factors are likely to contribute, meaning that direct causation is very hard to attribute.\n\nIt is important to remember too that climate change is not just global warming; the latter refers to an increase in global mean temperatures, but there is also an overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating that rainfall is at least as important for many vector-borne diseases. Rainfall episodes have also been shown to provide a very good early-warning sign a few months in advance for outbreaks of West Nile Virus.\n\nNew research on African anti-malaria mosquito control programmes that involve spraying houses (to kill indoor mosquitoes) and distributing bed nets also shows that both temperature and rainfall can influence the degree to which programmes decrease new infections and, crucially, their cost-effectiveness. However, whether or not this is substantial enough to affect regional policy decisions about scaling up mosquito control programmes depends on factors such as how rapidly insecticide resistance emerges, the human immune response to malaria, and country-specific conditions.\n\nIn terms of malaria elimination in Africa, adopting the same approach in all affected regions is unlikely to be the best way forward. However, there is some new evidence to suggest that if efforts continue to be concentrated on scaling-up current intervention programmes in regions close to elimination, the longer-term effects of climate change will become far less important. Indeed, one of the most effective ways of protecting human health against climate change in the long-term is to further strengthen current disease control efforts.\n\nMathematical models\n\nAs with the formulation of public health policies to deal with diseases such as Ebola, flu, and HIV, mathematical models are valuable tools that are widely used to make predictions about how different carrier-borne diseases are likely to respond to climatic changes. How reliable these predictions are is an important question and, like many areas of science, include unavoidable uncertainties. For example, people may change their behaviour and actions as climate change evolves -- for example by migrating to other areas -- which evidently makes forecasting more difficult.\n\nNew evidence has also shown that disease vectors may evolve in under a decade to changes in temperature, which conflicts with many current models that assume climate change only affects their ecology, not their evolution. Predictions that might be affected by climate change must therefore not only take account of these uncertainties, if they're to be more reliable and useful, but also recognise that these predictions cannot strictly be disproved until the future arrives.\n\nThis remains a very active research field, but considerable progress in our understanding has been made over the last ten to 15 years. Better data on the links between vectors, diseases they carry and the environment is definitely required, as are better ways of quantifying disease risk for different populations and different diseases.\n\nFuture challenges\n\nMany diseases have received very little attention so far on how climate change may affect future trends. One example is onchocerciasis (river blindness), for which tentative predictions suggest that we might expect substantial increases in the number of disease vectors in certain African regions over the coming decades.\n\nAlmost all models are currently based on single diseases, but many populations are unfortunately burdened with multiple diseases at any one time; understanding how climate change affects interactions between these diseases has attracted little attention to date.\n\nOne other important challenge for the field is the mismatch between the data current global climate models are able to provide and the information required by local public health officials to make more informed decisions; continued improvements in computing power are essential to progress. The predictions of our current models are not perfect and improvements in our understanding are certainly required.\n\nTo date, we have tended to react to disease outbreaks as they occur, but we need an increased focus on being more proactive; we cannot stop outbreaks of many of these diseases, but proactive risk management is less expensive (and more effective) than responding after a crisis. Ultimately, the challenge is not to address specific health risks due solely to climate change, but instead to ensure sustained progress is made towards decreasing the number of deaths and cases of these diseases for future generations."},"shares":{"facebook":32,"twitter":374,"google_plus":8,"total":414},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/21856bf7/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/52d2d5de/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNzV4MTc1IwplCWpwZw/a64c4301/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkzNTB4MzUwIwplCWpwZw/8780703d/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk4MHg4MCMKZQlqcGc/bc604a73/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5Lzc5L21vc3F1aXRvcy5lZTlhMS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNjB4MTYwIwplCWpwZw/a71d80c5/8ec/mosquitos.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1vjU33y","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Different diseases, transmitted by different vectors, respond in different ways to changing weather and climate patterns.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/"},{"_id":"54e60f2497b2f87749004acf","id":"2015/02/19/john-oliver-would-you-rather","title":"John Oliver tackles some very important issues in 'Would You Rather'","title_tag":null,"author":"Laura Vitto","post_date":"2015-02-19T16:28:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 16:28:03 +0000","sort_key":"1yotXl","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/02/19/john-oliver-would-you-rather/","content":{"plain":"Would you rather have screaming nipples or a tongue that constantly interrupts you?

Walmart follows other retailers that have boosted hourly pay recently, but because it's the nation's largest private employer, the impact of its move will be more closely watched.\n\nIn addition to raises, Walmart said it plans to make changes to how workers are scheduled and add training programs for sales staff so that employees can more easily map out their future at the company.\n\nSee also: What Retail Stores Want to Do With Your Consumer Data\n\n\"We are trying to create a meritocracy where you can start somewhere and end up just as high as your hard work and your capacity will enable you to go,\" CEO Doug McMillon told the AP during an interview this week at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nThe changes, which Wal-Mart announced Thursday as it reported stronger-than-expected fourth quarter results, come at a time when there's growing concern for the plight of the nation's hourly workers.\n\nThousands of U.S. hourly workers and their supporters have staged protests across the country in the past couple of years to call attention to their financial struggles. Business groups and politicians have jumped into the fray, debating a proposal by President Obama to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. And a new Associated Press-GfK poll found that most Americans support increasing the minimum wage.\n\nAt the same time, competition for retail workers is becoming increasingly stiff. As shoppers get more mobile savvy, retailers are seeking sales staff that's more skilled at customer service. But in the improving economy, the most desirable retail workers feel more confident in hopping from job to job.\n\nWalmart, which has struggled for two years with sluggish sales, follows other big retailers that have announced plans to increase pay for its workers. Swedish home furnishings retailer Ikea this year gave thousands of workers at its U.S. division a 17% average raise to $10.76 an hour. And clothing chain Gap Inc. raised its minimum hourly wage to $9 last year and to $10 this year.\n\nBecause of its massive size and impact, Walmart has faced outsized pressure by organized labor groups to raise its starting hourly wages to $15 and provide workers with more consistent hours. With its new changes, the company's average full-time wage will be $13 an hour, up from $12.85. For part-time workers, the hourly wage will be $10, up from $9.48.\n\nThat's below the $14.65 average that hourly retail workers in a non-supervisory role earn, according to government data that includes people who work at auto dealers and other outlets that would likely pay more than discounters like Walmart. But it's above the $9.93 average hourly pay for cashiers and low level retail sales staff, according to Hay Group's survey of 140 retailers with annual sales of $500 million.\n\nEd Lazear, a Stanford University economics professor who served as an informal adviser to Walmart during the past year for the program, applauded Walmart's moves.\n\n\"It's positioning itself to be competitive,\" he said. \"This is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of some of Wal-Mart's plans:\n\nStart raising entry level wages to at least $9 an hour in April and to at least $10 an hour by February of next year. That includes the less than 6,000 workers who make the federal minimum wage. Sam's Club locations will offer a starting hourly wage of at least $9.50 or higher in all markets, and at least $10.50 by next year.\n\nRaise the floor and ceiling of its pay range for each position in most stores. For example, the pay range for cashiers is $7.65 to $16. The new range will be $9.00 to $17.55.\n\nRaise the starting wage for some department managers to at least $13 an hour by this summer and at least $15 an hour by early next year.\n\nGive newly hired workers a $9 per hour training wage and when they successfully complete the six-month training program, raise it to $10 an hour. Those workers can pursue one of three career paths: hourly supervisor, a specialty path like working in a bakery or deli or expand their skills in their current role.\n\nGive hourly workers hands-on training in areas including teamwork, merchandising, retail fundamentals and communications. Store leaders like hourly supervisors will get refresher training on people leadership skills so that they can help workers grow and advance.\n\nRoll out a program that offers some workers fixed schedules so they can be able to choose the same hours each week. The program is being tested in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nTeam up with its nonprofit, Walmart Foundation, to invest a total of $100 million spread over the next five years to support programs that help advance careers for entry level workers in the industry.\n\nMcMillon, whose first job at Walmart was an hourly position loading trucks during college, said the company is making the changes in both wages and training because it realizes it needs to do more than just pay more. In a survey Walmart conducted of 24,000 workers, it found that many don't know how to move up at Walmart.\n\nMcMillon, who became CEO last year, said he's hoping that if the company invests in its workers, they will provide better customer service. And ultimately, he hopes that will encourage shoppers to spend more.\n\n\"We want to make it really clear that working at Walmart is a great opportunity,\" he said. \"Time will tell what the significance of the decisions will be.\""},"shares":{"facebook":14,"twitter":81,"total":95},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJOTUweDUzNCMKZQlqcGc/dd15ff84/523/Walmart.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTQzOHgKZQlqcGc/4b50af8b/523/Walmart.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTc1eDE3NSMKZQlqcGc/8961c0ff/523/Walmart.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMzUweDM1MCMKZQlqcGc/a519c68f/523/Walmart.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJODB4ODAjCmUJanBn/3026bef1/523/Walmart.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2YxL1dhbG1hcnQuYTRmZmYuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTYweDE2MCMKZQlqcGc/2b3f7d03/523/Walmart.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1z2lcUf","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"consumer-tracking-retailers"}]},"excerpt":"Walmart Stores is spending $1 billion to make changes to how it pays and trains U.S. hourly workers as the embattled retailer tries to reshape the image that its stores offer dead-end jobs.

The documents are dated from 2010.\n\nThe hack gave the NSA and British Government Communications Headquarters the \"potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world\u2019s cellular communications, including both voice and data,\" according to The Intercept.\n\nSee also: 11 free tools to protect your online activity from surveillance\n\nThe company named in the report is Gemalto, a Netherlands company that makes SIM cards, with clients reportedly including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and 450 more providers from around the world. The spy agencies obtained encryption keys -- which The Intercept described as \"the keys to the castle\" -- allowing American and British government officials to monitor mobile communications, potentially without warrants or wiretaps.\n\nGemalto has a presence in 85 countries. The monitoring was untraceable, according to the report. A Gemalto representative said \u201cthe most important thing for us now is to understand the degree\u201d of the breach, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done, so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again, and also to make sure that there\u2019s no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years,\"  Paul Beverly, Gemalto executive vice president, told The Intercept.\n\nOne privacy expert, with the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that \"will send a shock wave through the security community.\" The information obtained by state-backed hackers is essentially the master keys to mobile devices.\n\nA Gemalto spokesperson released a statement to Mashable, saying the company keeps a log of attempted cyberattacks but can \"make no link between any of those past attempts\" and The Intercept's report:\n\nWe take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such highly sophisticated technique to try to obtain SIM card data. From what we gathered at this moment, the target was not Gemalto, per se - it was an attempt to try and cast the widest net possible to reach as many mobile phones as possible.  There have been many reported state sponsored attacks as of late, that all have gained attention both in the media and amongst businesses, this truly emphasizes how serious cyber security is in this day and age.\n\nThe Intercept was co-founded by former Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald, who initially broke the story about Snowden in 2013.\n\nMashable has reached out to the wireless providers named in the report. This story will be updated with any additional comment.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

More than 200,000 developers use Flurry, but the suite also leverages Yahoo's native advertising and marketing tools. The suite itself is comprised of five products: Flurry Analytics, Flurry Pulse, Yahoo App Publishing, Yahoo Search in Apps and Yahoo App Marketing. \n\nFlurry Analytics is the refreshed version of Flurry's existing analytics service, which provides developers with insights into how people are using their apps. Flurry Pulse is a new software development kit (SDK) that lets developers easily share Flurry's insight's with partners, and Yahoo Search in Apps provides better integration of search tools within apps. \n\nBut for Yahoo, the two most significant parts of the developer suite are Yahoo App Publishing and Yahoo App Marketing, which leverage the company's BrightRoll and Gemini advertising platforms. Gemini combines native, video and social advertising.\n\n\"We learned a lot at Yahoo in our transformation from banner ads to native advertisements,\" Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said during her opening keynote at Thursday's event. \"Advertisers have clear goals. Yahoo really strives to take the power of ads and ad targeting to mobile. It's no surprise there's huge demand for mobile advertising.\"\n\nYahoo App Publishing is an ad platform that gives developers ways to integrate native ads from Yahoo and BrightRoll into their apps. Likewise, Yahoo App Marketing lets developers use Gemini to target new users.\n\nThe goal of all these tools is to lure developers with effective monetization tools while also increasing the reach of Yahoo search and ads. Mayer has increasingly focused on search, particularly on mobile, since she took over as CEO of the company in 2012.\n\nMayer also touted her success in getting Yahoo to focus on mobile, which she described as a \"hobby\" for the company prior to her arrival. Yahoo now has more than 500 people working full-time on mobile (outside of Flurry), according to Mayer. Yahoo's revenue from mobile ads grew to $254 million last quarter, accounting for 20% of the company's total revenues -- a significant increase but still well behind competitors such as Facebook and Twitter. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

To make sure that franchisees fall in line with the new naming, the company is asking fans to upload photos to Instagram that depict storefronts that are still sporting the old logo. The stores are run by franchisees, but some are also corporate-owned. \n\nSee also: Little Caesars' new pizza is wrapped in a mere 3 1/2 feet of bacon\n\nIf you upload one such photo and use the hashtags #LogoInformants and #Sweeps before April 27, you'll be eligible to win free pizza for a year or a $10 Domino's gift card. The rules specify that Domino's has the right to refuse your entry if it thinks your photo is has been tampered with.\n\nIt's not clear what recupercussions the franchisees with old signs will face. The campaign, by Crispin Porter + Bogusky, accomplishes a dual mission: making sure the name update is consistent across all its stores and publicizing the name change via social media (all for the cost of $10,000 in gift cards and five commitments of free pizza for a year).\n\nThe campaign is the latest turnaround effort from Crispin, which has shepherded the brand from its 2009 nadir, in which a YouTube video showing an employee putting boogers in a pizza went viral, to a subsequent five-year-plus sales increase. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Like the higher-profile Academy Awards' categories for best director or best cinematographer, this behind-the-scenes film work praises a strangely homogenous group. \n\nThis year's screenplay nominees, save for Alejandro G. I\u00f1arritu, Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone and Armando Bo of Birdman, are all white men, along with many of the other categories, which has already garnered its fair share of backlash (Ava DuVernay snub, anyone?). \n\nSee also: Oscar noms: 'Birdman' and 'Budapest' clean up, stunning snubs for 'Selma'\n\nIn the past eight decades of Oscar history, the prestigious gold statuettes for both screenplay categories have only gone to:\n\n Two black men (both for adapted screenplay): John Ridley in 2014 for 12 Years a Slave, and Geoffrey Fletcher in 2010 for Precious. Only one black woman has been nominated: Suzanne De Passe in 1973 for Lady Sings the Blues.\n\nOne Latino winner: Spanish writer/director Pedro Almodovar in 2003 for Talk to Her. However, there have been numerous Latino nominees in history, among them male nominees (both Mexican) Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Guillermo del Toro and Argentine female nominee Aida Bortnik.\n\nZero Asian winners. Six have been nominated in history, among them M. Night Shyamalan and female screenwriters Hui-Ling Wang and Iris Yamashita.\n\nZero Native American winners or nominees.\n\nNo women of color have ever won a screenplay Oscar, save for Thelma and Louise writer Callie Khouri whose father is Lebanese-American. However, there have been numerous white female winners: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (twice), Emma Thompson and Sofia Coppola are just a few examples. \n\nWhy has this category remained so exclusive? Take a look at the voting pool, for starters. \n\nAcademy nominees and winners are decided upon by an elite voting group of about 6,000 members. According to an in-depth 2012 report by the Los Angeles Times, the executive and writers branch of the Academy is 98% white. Women made up only 19% of the screenwriters section of the Academy.\n\n\"If you\u2019re at an Academy event, it looks like a gathering of the U.S. Senate -- a bunch of old white guys,\" says Tom O'Neill, film expert and editor of Gold Derby, a popular Oscars' prediction site. \"You think, 'Oh my god, these are the glamorous, cool, inner elite of Hollywood?'\" \n\nWith that overwhelming male presence, how, at the very least, have white women managed to escape Hollywood's pervasive sexism? \n\n \"The writer is the most powerless person on a film set,\" O'Neill tells Mashable. \"Once that script is done, it\u2019s in the hands of a tyrannical, omnipotent director.\"\n\nEssentially, \"they'll let women in\" to this part of the filmmaking process, O'Neill says frankly. That's a cruel, powerful sentiment echoed by many screenwriters in the business. Oscar-winning screenwriters (who later ended up taking the reins in the director's chair) like Diablo Cody have voiced these perils, saying in an interview \"most writers are shoved aside as soon as the film goes into development.\" Nora Ephron, nominated thrice for classics like Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally, said she became a director because she saw how powerless screenwriting was (she knew firsthand, since both her parents were also screenwriters). Diana Ossana, who won an Oscar in 2006 for co-writing Brokeback Mountain said she wouldn't have been taken seriously without her writing partner Larry McMurtry, adding that \"writers are considered bottom feeders\" in Hollywood. \n\nDespite its reputation for powerlessness, female screenwriters have made strides in the field for decades now. Oscar barriers were broken as far back as 1930, when Frances Marion scooped up a \"Best Writing - Achievement\" award for The Big House.\n\nHowever, that hasn't extended to female screenwriters of color, likely and in large part by virtue of the Academy's small, mostly white membership. The only way to diversify the pool of voting members is by inviting more worthy, diverse people of color, which Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs is trying to do, albeit slowly. One of the Academy's biggest problems in this regard is its stubborn voting size. \n\n\"They can\u2019t just invite 100-plus people a year to join the Academy,\" O'Neill says. \"They have to maybe allow the academy to get 7,000 or 8000 members, instead of this elite 6,000.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Academy invited 271 new members, with an emphasis on diversity. Lupita Nyong'o, Pharrell Williams and Hayao Miyazaki were just a few of the elite newcomers. \n\nHowever, then the issue becomes finding more people of color who are on the ground, creating praiseworthy works of art. That onus falls back on the studios and the types of projects they greenlight (which typically favor franchises). Writer-director Phil Alden, a longtime Academy member, told the Los Angeles Times, \"We start off with one hand tied behind our back ... If the industry as a whole is not doing a great job in opening up its ranks, it's very hard for us to diversify our membership.\"\n\nOne practical way diversity in film can increase is by adapting a \"modified version of the NFL's Rooney Rule,\" Dr. Stacy L. Smith of USC Annenberg tells Mashable. She directs the school's Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative, and recently helmed a devastating report about the extreme lack of diversity in film. (For example, out of 600 films from 2007-2010 and 20012-2013, only 25.9% of speaking characters were minorities.)\n\n\"When directors are hired, this rule would ask for the inclusion of women and people of color on the lists of open directing assignments,\" Dr. Smith says.

Then it seemed to fizzle out just as quickly. \n\nThe Vermont-based startup took a big step to shape its public perception on Thursday with the hiring of Rene Alegria, the former CEO of Latina-focused website Mamiverse, as its first chief marketing officer. In that role, Alegria intends to better guide Ello's \"narrative\" and show \"what Ello stands for.\" And as he is quick to point out, what Ello stands for has little to do with competing against Facebook.\n\nSee also: Ello's Creator Knows His Social Network Sounds Stupid\n\n\"The media created this catfight last fall -- the catfight amongst social networks -- positioning us as the anti,\" Alegria told Mashable in an interview. \"That's not what we stand for.\"\n\n\"What we're working toward,\" he said, \"is galvanizing the creative community.\"\n\nDuring the nearly six months since Ello first exploded, the startup continued to add new features, raised funding and doubled down on its promise not to monetize through advertising or by collecting user data. \n\nThis spring, Ello expects to launch a mobile app and come out of beta. That, Alegria said, will give the company an opportunity to reintroduce and explain itself as a social network that \"merges fun and artistry,\" and removes the \"fear that what you're doing is being watched and manipulated by Big Brother.\"\n\nJust don't call any of Ello's forthcoming messaging \"ads.\" Unsurprisingly, the ad-free social network has a different conception of its marketing efforts.\n\n\"We\u2019re currently not playing with the idea of dropping any ads,\" Alegria said. \"We are absolutely planning on internal campaigns that capture the spirit of our artist community.\" \n\nInternal campaigns, not ads. Got it. \n\n\"Really not ads, because we are not going to buy placement for them. But it is marketing our ideals to the world,\" he added.\n\nWhen a service -- even a niche, unfinished service like Ello -- is mentioned in the same breath as Facebook, it can receive a Facebook-sized spotlight. When it becomes clear that the service is not, in fact, a direct competitor -- well, the following chart from Google shows what happens.\n\nBut the team at Ello seem fine with that reality. \n\n\"We don\u2019t need to have 2 billion people on our network. That's not our aim or our goal,\" Alegria said. \"We just want people to get onto the network to experience it now and going forward.\"\n\n Have something to add to this story?

The ability to make those great GIF-able moments easier to share makes this a perfect fit for The Voice fan base,\" Jared Goldsmith, NBC's vice-president of digital marketing, told Mashable.  \n\nAmong the new and old GIFs that will appear, some will show up in \"GIF Stories,\" which are multipanel GIFs merged together to tell a story or react to memes.\n\nIt's the latest feature to make The Voice's social media engine tick. Up until SNL's 40th anniversary episode, The Voice's May 13 episode in Season 6 was the most tweeted-about TV series episode since Nielsen began measuring Twitter TV conversation in 2011.\n\nIn previous seasons, the show has kept viewers engaged online with digital elements, such as enabling them to vote on Facebook and purchase music on iTunes, showcasing animations from a Tumblr artist during live performances, and offering an interactive second-screen app that lets fans act as a fifth coach. Recently, The Voice launched the #VoiceSave, a Twitter voting initiative where viewers get to save a contestant from being eliminated.\r\n \r\nSeason 8 of The Voice premieres on Feb. 23. \n\nBONUS: 20 songs turning 20 in 2015"},"shares":{"twitter":715,"google_plus":5,"facebook":71,"total":791},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/a9e17d38/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/2d7e8bd9/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/92bf944a/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/782c7ea2/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/524f84ac/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAyLzE5L2Y0L3RoZXZvaWNlc2VhLjQ2NzY2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/50d3daaa/7f8/the-voice-season-8-coaches.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1vKRORR","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/02/17/beyonce-ed-sheeran-video-stevie-wonder-master-blaster-jammin/"}],"gallery":[{"data-id":20329,"class":"content-gallery"}]},"velocity":[868,866,872,876,892,904,926,934,950,955,963,969,973,975,976,976,984,982,987,990,992,993,992,991,988,989,1000,999,986,983,980,975,970,967,964,961,957,942,937,934,928,921,918,914,910,905,900,895,889,882],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/"},{"_id":"54e6304112d2cd752f00369b","id":"2015/02/19/peter-greste-al-jazeera-egypt","title":"Peter Greste says meditation helped him avoid 'mind f*ck' in Egyptian prison","title_tag":null,"author":"Blathnaid Healy","post_date":"2015-02-19T18:49:24+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 18:49:24 +0000","sort_key":"1yowIG","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/02/19/peter-greste-al-jazeera-egypt/","content":{"plain":"LONDON -- Studying, exercise and meditation were what got Al-Jazeera journalist Peter Greste through the 400 days he spent incarcerated in Egypt.\n\nSee also: The Egyptian government's war on free speech\n\n49-year-old Greste was in London Thursday, for the first time since he was freed earlier this month by presidential decree in Egypt.\n\n.@PeterGreste being welcomed back to the @frontlineclub pic.twitter.com/ALMevkOVh2\u2014 Blathnaid Healy (@blathnaidhealy) February 19, 2015\n\nHe and fellow journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohammed, who were last week released on bail pending a retrial, were arrested in 2013 and charged with crimes that included spreading false news.

Fahmy was hospitalised at the time.\n\nGreste, who was being interviewed by Al-Jazeera correspondent Sue Turton, one of nine journalists charged in absentia and sentenced to ten years by the same Egyptian court, was keen to highlight the other people, including a number of students, who have also been caught up in the trial, accused of being members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe retrial of Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who remain in Egypt, is due to get underway later this month.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Beginning with daguerrotypes, photographers used double exposures to create humorous effects.\n\nPhoto manipulation was soon employed in numerous ways, as early photography had several limitations. Correct exposures in landscape photography often led to the sky being overexposed, for example. To circumnavigate this, photographers combined two images, each section with the correct exposure. \n\n'Spirit' photography used multiple exposures to depict the medium or subject with ghostly presences in the same image. \n\nPhoto manipulation could illustrate concepts, such as the proposal to allow airships to dock at the top of the Empire State building. \n\nThe advertising industry used it to improve the appearance of products.\n\nThe artistic community also took up photo manipulation, for instance, with the creation of narrative images. Later it was adopted by the constructivist movement in Russia in the 1920s, and then again by the surrealists.\n\nParticularly controversial was the use of photo manipulation for political purposes or propaganda. Notable dictators such as Stalin erased political opponents from the historical record, or fabricated meetings that had never taken place.\r\nToday the photographic medium is digital, and photo manipulation is easily within the reach of the computer literate through software like Photoshop.

He\u2019s often called a \u201cClinical Writer,\u201d but there is little clinical about Sacks\u2019 prose.\n\nIn 2010, he memorably wrote about his own struggle with a mild form of prosopagnosia:\n\n\u201cMy problem with recognizing faces extends not only to my nearest and dearest but also to myself. Thus, on several occasions I have apologized for almost bumping into a large bearded man, only to realize that the large bearded man was myself in a mirror.\u201d\n\nThe work and malady has a direct connection to Sacks' classic collection of clinical stories in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, which, in one chapter, described a man\u2019s struggle with severe visual agnosia.\n\nIn the story, which gives the book its name, Sacks describes his first meeting with Dr. P. \n\nSacks' ability to put the reader in the examining room, and relay both the shock and subtle humor when Dr. P mistakes his foot for his shoe, is what makes reading Sacks' writing so worthwhile.\n\n'Can I help?' [Sacks] asked.\r\n'Help what? Help whom?'\r\n'Help you put on your shoe.'\r\n'Ach,' [Dr. P.] said, 'I had forgotten the shoe,' adding, sotto voice, 'The shoe? The shoe?' He seemed baffled.\r\n'Your shoe,' I repeated. 'Perhaps you'd put it on.'\r\nHe continued to look downwards, though not at the shoe, with an intense but misplaced concentration. Finally, his gaze settled on his foot: 'That is my shoe, yes?'\r\nDid I mis-hear? Did he mis-see?\r\n'My eyes,' he explained, and put a hand to his foot. 'This is my shoe, no?'\r\n'No, it is not. That's your foot. There is your shoe.'\r\n'Ah! I thought that was my foot.'\r\nWas he joking? Was he mad? Was he blind? If this was one of his 'strange mistakes', it was the strangest mistake I had ever come across.\r\n \n\nSacks' ability to make the abstract both real and personal turned the science of the mind into a window on the soul. His larger theme, in essence, is the unknowability of the human mind: We\u2019re human beings who perceive our world through this soft and complex organ we still barely understand. Yet Sacks has never stopped trying to make sense of it -- and all the ways in which the mind can turn that perception inside out.\n\nThe New York Times Op-Ed reminds us of how often Sacks has sought to help us experience life and the body\u2019s unexpected changes through his own perception. He started this process early and wrote entertainingly in 2012 of his own early experiments with psychotropics -- all in the name of science, of course.\n\n\u201cIt started with cannabis. A friend in Topanga Canyon, where I lived at the time, offered me a joint; I took two puffs and was transfixed by what happened then. I gazed at my hand, and it seemed to fill my visual field, getting larger and larger while at the same time moving away from me. Finally, it seemed to me, I could see a hand stretched across the universe, light-years or parsecs in length. It still looked like a living, human hand, yet this cosmic hand somehow also seemed like the hand of God. My first pot experience was marked by a mixture of the neurological and the divine.\u201d\n\nIn a lifetime of neurological examination, something else stands out about Sacks: His never-ending desire to help others, invariably through the enlightenment of information. In his 2009 TED talk What hallucinations reveal about our minds, Sacks described a 95-year-old woman, blind since the age of 90, who was now \"seeing\" things. They were, of course, hallucinations, but they came unbidden and seemed completely unmoored from reality. \n\nI said, \"There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness. This was originally described,\" I said, \"right back in the 18th century, by a man called Charles Bonnet. And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome. There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind. You have Charles Bonnet syndrome.\"\n\nAnd she was very relieved at this, that there was nothing seriously the matter, and also rather curious. She said, \"Who is this Charles Bonnet?\" She said, \"Did he have them himself?\" And she said, \"Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.\" \"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.\" Well, so I did tell the nurses.\"\n\nThe world also knows Sacks because one of his best-known works, Awakenings, was turned into a 1990 film starring the late Robin Williams.\n\nPublished in 1973, Awakenings told the true story of Sacks' work with patients suffering from \u201csleeping sickness,\u201d or encephalitis lethargica, and the effects a new \u201cawakening\u201d drug had on their condition.\n\nThe movie turned Sacks into a widely-known public figure in part because of Williams' sympathetic portrayal.\n\nWhen Williams died last summer, Sacks recalled, in a brief New Yorker Culture piece, a lunch they had had together:\n\nWhen we had lunch together a few months ago, we got to talking about reptiles\u2014Robin had had a pet iguana\u2014and he combined a zoologist\u2019s knowledge of lizards and turtles with an inner understanding of what it was like to be them, and he could imitate their postures and behavior to perfection. Imitate is too mild a word; he became them as, in Awakenings, he became me.\n\nWilliams' portrayal of Sacks was among his most affecting and though the patients\u2019 awakenings were depicted with a sort of wonder, Sacks was not portrayed as heroic.\n\nThe point is, for all Sacks' accomplishments -- both present and future as Professor of Neurobiology at the NYU School of Medicine -- he has in virtually all of his writing portrayed himself as one of us. And yes, he may share our human foibles, but he is particularly gifted, possessing an endlessly inquisitive mind and the tenacity to never stop seeking answers.\n\nThe presentation of his prognosis in The New York Times on Thursday was not a sad swan song but a declaration of a new clarity of focus. \u201cI feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential. I must focus on myself, my work and my friends,\u201d Sacks writes.\n\nI fully expect him to take us along with him on this last journey. There will surely be at least one more Oliver Sacks New Yorker Neurologist Notebook talking about life\u2019s diminution and what the mind must make of what comes after.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

So much that the city is scrambling to open up a second \"snow dump\" after it nearly broke FAA regulations by building the first snow pile high enough to nearly interfere with aircraft landing and taking off from the airport. \n\nLike much of the rest of New England, the city has been absolutely buried by snow during the past month. Storm after storm after storm has dumped nearly 5 feet of snow in the coastal city, including more than 2 feet in February alone. \n\nSee also: Despite frigid conditions in the East, U.S. seeing more record warmth this winter\n\nPortland is the largest city in Maine, and is famous for its narrow streets, historic harbor and lately, for its thriving restaurant and art scenes. \n\nLike their colleagues in other communities, Portland officials have been forced to improvise an environmentally friendly way to dispose of all the snow, instead of just dumping it in the harbor, as was previously common practice. Snow removal crews have been building a massive snow pile that is close to Portland International Jetport. \n\nBut as the snow continues to fall, the pile has grown higher and higher. Now, it's apparently so high that it poses a hazard to landing and departing flights at the jetport.\n\nOfficials have had to open a second large snow dump to avoid running afoul of FAA regulations, according to WCSH-TV. \"It can send a signal that there is some sort of structure there, and it could affect their instrumentation as they land and possibly even take off, as well. So we're mindful of that,\" Portland Public Services director Mike Bobinsky told the local station.\n\nJetport director Paul Bradbury told WCSH that the FAA has set up protection zones around airports with height limits; the regulations are in place particularly to ensure smaller planes have the clearance they require. He said the height of the pile isn't typically a concern for the airport, since some melting usually takes place between snowstorms. However, this year, the frigid temperatures during February have prevented any significant melting to occur.\n\n\"Very rare, but in the past it does become an issue that you start to hit the maximum amount of snow, but I can tell you that's very rare,\" Bradbury said.\n\nPortland has halted snow dumping at the site, and is opening a new snow dump -- or as Boston calls it, a \"snow farm\" -- elsewhere in the city for the first time.\n\nBradbury said the snow dump is \"just like a tree that grows too high,\" the Portland Press-Herald reported. The FAA limit requires obstructions close to a landing and take-off path to be 56 feet high or below, but the city has kept it at 40 feet or lower in order to use large machinery on it for moving snow around. \u201cThey try to make a nice plateau, and fill the entire site to that level,\u201d Bradbury told the newspaper.\n\n Have something to add to this story?
