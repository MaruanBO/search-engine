Three of the biggest "names" in the revenge porn business have all had the legal system come down on them, concluding in the past few weeks. At the end of January, Craig Brittain, of "Is Anybody Down," <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150129/13293029859/turns-out-ftc-was-paying-close-attention-to-revenge-porn-idiot-craig-brittain.shtml">settled with the FTC</a>. A week later, Kevin Bollaert, of "YouGotPosted," <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150202/17334629885/revenge-porn-site-owner-convicted-extortion.shtml">was found guilty</a> of extortion by a jury. And now, just a couple of weeks after that, the guy often credited with creating the first revenge porn site, Hunter Moore, with "Is Anyone Up," has <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1670887/256202614-hunter-moore-plea-deal.pdf" target="_blank">settled the Justice Department's case against him</a>.
<br/><br/>
As with the Craig Brittain settlement, some may find the end result of this settlement less than satisfying -- but it appears that Moore will still likely end up in jail like Bollaert. Moore will agree to plead guilty to two counts (out of nine) in his indictment: one for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) -- for supposedly hacking into computers to get naked pictures to post to his site -- and a second one for identity fraud in impersonating another. He will also be limited in his use of computers and devices, and will have to share screen names and passwords to his probation officer. In exchange for this, the prosecutors will ask the judge for a "two-level reduction in the applicable Sentencing Guidelines offense level." The court does not need to go along with this request, but usually will. As the settlement notes, in pleading guilty to these two charges, Moore is facing a maximum sentence of seven years in jail and a potential fine of $500,000 -- though the final result will likely be lower. It appears that the <i>minimum</i> in the sentencing guidelines is two years, so it seems likely that he will spend a fair bit of time in jail.
<br/><br/>
It's interesting to see all three of these cases resolve (in some manner -- since Bollaert is apparently appealing his case), all within a three-week period. As <a href="http://adamsteinbaugh.com/2015/02/18/hunter-moore-takes-plea-deal-will-go-to-prison/" target="_blank">Adam Steinbaugh notes</a>, a fourth key player in early revenge porn, Casey Meyering, is about to go on trial for extortion as well (and the guy Moore supposedly paid to hack into computers for his site, is still facing a trial in a few months). There are, of course, other revenge porn sites out there, but these were the earliest -- and biggest. Steinbaugh further notes that:
<blockquote><i>
In one month, approximately half of the operators of dedicated revenge porn sites have been sanctioned, convicted, or are likely to be convicted. Stunning.
</i></blockquote>
He further notes that the surviving revenge porn sites (he's known for tracking these things -- and tracking down and exposing the operators) have basically all moved to Tor hidden sites and out of the US.
<br/><br/>
It does seem noteworthy, again, that all of these results came about without dismantling Section 230 of the CDA or requiring special new "anti-revenge porn" laws, like some are calling for. Yet, I imagine it won't stop the calls for such legislative action.</div>

<p>
Nothing's driving the acquisition of data faster than, well, <i>driving</i>. As new technology makes its way into vehicles, so does the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141119/10035029193/automakers-like-totally-promise-not-to-abuse-ocean-location-data-their-cars-now-collect.shtml" target="_blank">apparent desire</a> to harvest information about the vehicle itself. Between the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141119/10035029193/automakers-like-totally-promise-not-to-abuse-ocean-location-data-their-cars-now-collect.shtml" target="_blank">outside harvesting</a> (automatic plate readers that gather plate/location data, as well as photos of vehicle occupants) and the "inside" transmissions, there's very little any number of unknown entities won't know about a person's driving habits. And that's not even including what's transmitted and collected by drivers' omnipresent smartphones and their installed apps.
<br/><br/>
<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/et-tu-detroit" target="_blank">Sen. Edward Markey has expressed some alarm</a> at the amount of data being collected (and distributed) by vehicle manufacturers. His office has produced a report [<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2015-02-06_MarkeyReport-Tracking_Hacking_CarSecurity%202.pdf" target="_blank">pdf link</a>] showing that while many manufacturers are involved in collecting data, very few of them seem concerned about the attendant risks. Even worse, many respondents to his office's questionnaire seem to show very little understanding of the underlying technology and most have not made an effort to fully inform customers as to how much is being collected or how it's being distributed.
<br/><br/>
Drivers of today's connected cars aren't going to like the report's findings.
<blockquote>
<i>Nearly 100% of cars on the market include wireless technologies that could pose vulnerabilities to hacking or privacy intrusions.</i></blockquote>
While some basic security measures have been implemented, the fact remains that transmitting data always poses a risk. Three of the 14 manufacturers that responded to Markey's questions had actually let their security measures stagnate or <i>decrease</i> from 2013 to 2014, even as the amount of data transmitted rose. Worse, many of the respondents deployed security measures in a "haphazard and inconsistent" fashion, and nearly all respondents seemed unable to fully process the questions posed by Markey's office.
<blockquote>
<i>Of the 16 automobile manufacturers that responded to the letter, 13 of them addressed these questions in some way. Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, and Mazda did not respond to the question at all, and five other manufacturers provided general responses that addressed the question as a whole instead of providing specific responses to the questions&rsquo; sub-parts.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>[...]</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Seven of the manufacturers stated that they use third-party testing to verify their security measures, while 5 stated that they do not and 4 did not respond to this part of the question.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>[...]</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>The manufacturers were also asked about how they secure this type of software delivery [updates/patches]. Each manufacturer responded with descriptions of how they provide such software through authorized dealers with the appropriate tools. Automobile security experts consulted by Senator Markey&rsquo;s staff said that all of the responses are similar in that they presume a malicious actor could not access or acquire the technologies that mechanics have. They state that software updates for systems should be cryptographically verified by the ECU being updated in order to effectively prevent intrusions.</i></blockquote>
These four-wheeled tracking devices are collecting and transmitting tons of data, including GPS location, sudden accelerations/decelerations, seatbelt usage, destinations entered into navigation systems, last location parked, distance and time traveled and a variety of information on other driving components. Almost all of this is transmitted back to the manufacturer for their own use.
<br/><br/>
Nearly 100% of 2014 vehicles record and transmit driving history. Most of these manufacturers could not provide a satisfactory answer as to how they secure this data during transmission and more than half store this information "off-board" at their own data centers. Manufacturers seem to consider "on-board" collections as inherently secure.
<blockquote>
<i>In the case of on-board storage, <b>no manufacturer described any security system to protect that data</b>, and several of them noted that no security measure is needed since accessing data would require a hardwire connection.</i></blockquote>
But that doesn't mean they treat wireless transmissions with much more care.
<blockquote>
<i>Regarding security measures to protect data that is wirelessly transmitted outside the vehicle, only 6 responses were received. Of those, 5 provided vague responses naming encryption, passwords, or general IT security practices, and only 1 specifically mentioned that they designed their systems to limit the transfer of personally identifiable information.</i></blockquote>
Part of this is due to the fact that automakers' security measures are purely voluntariy at this point. But the fact that it would likely take a federal mandate to improve security is disappointing. Not only are manufacturers less than forthcoming about how much data they're collecting, but they're apparently uninterested in providing a minimal level of customer service, i.e., proactively assuring these data transmissions are secure.
<br/><br/>
As for the data harvesting itself, manufacturers can't seem to find a better justification for this than "improving the customer experience" -- a phrase pretty much synonymous with "selling customers more stuff" or "collecting for collecting's sake." Most manufacturers retain this data for one to ten years, with only one manufacturer offering the option for users to delete their data at any time. But that single nod to customer agency is far outweighed by the general indifference shown by the rest.
<br/><br/>
Markey's report finds that purchasers may be allowed to "opt out" of certain collections, but this often comes at the expense of certain functions. <i>No</i> manufacturer presents this information up front, preferring to hide it in owner's manuals and terms of service agreements. The default should be "opt-in," with upfront explanations of what, how and why data is collected. But that would lead to a dearth of information, and automakers, like many other private companies, prefer to gather data first and deal with the fallout later.
<br/><br/>
Although it goes unmentioned in Markey's report, there's also the question of how this data is handled when the government comes looking for it. Most of what's collected would presumably fall under the Third Party Doctrine (with drivers "knowingly" turning this information over because of page 173 in the owner's manual, etc.), which means it can be acquired by law enforcement/intelligence agencies with minimal effort/paperwork. There are also other government intrusions that need to be considered as well, like California's desire to tie <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150115/11354229711/to-enforce-emissions-standards-state-governments-are-looking-to-ride-shotgun-constituents-vehicles.shtml" target="_blank">state-enforced emission standards</a> to driving information already gathered by a number of manufacturers. Not only are manufacturers <i>not</i> guarding against having their collections hijacked by criminals, they seem equally unconcerned about safeguarding this vast amount of data from the government itself.

You might recall that top cable industry lobbyist Michael Powell, formerly head of the FCC, got much of the current Title II debate rolling back in 2002 when he <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/News_Releases/2002/nrcb0201.html">reclassified cable broadband as an "information service."</a> This effectively opened the door to a massive era of broadband deregulation Powell and friends at the time insisted would usher forth an immense new wave of broadband competition. If you've checked your broadband bill or oh, stepped outside lately, you may have noticed that this utopian broadband landscape never materialized.
<br/><br/>
A huge part of Powell's justification for rampant deregulation (or really, the need for any meaningful regulators whatsoever) was that broadband over powerline was going to make the market <b>so damn competitive</b> that regulators really wouldn't be needed. Powell repeatedly ignored engineers who stated broadband over powerline <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061130/134052.shtml">caused massive radio interference</a> in trial markets, and wasn't suitable for even a niche broadband deployment technology. As such, Powell's "great broadband hope" never took flight, and what we wound up with was a more potent and uncompetitive broadband duopoly than ever before.
<br/><br/>
Now heading the cable industry's biggest lobbying operation, the NCTA, Powell has popped up with a little bit of revisionist history, as he heavily criticizes the current FCC's shift back to Title II. According to Powell, the cable industry will most certainly sue over the FCC's new rules, and he blames <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/powell-ncta-highly-likely-sue-fcc-over-title-ii/387982">everybody but himself</a> for turning net neutrality into a "partisan issue":
<blockquote><i>"He suggested that after the principles became a declaratory ruling under the chairmanship of his successor, Kevin Martin, it they were probably applied in a "reckless way" [the Comcast/BitTorrent decision] that led to being overturned in court," which he said put a bigger spotlight on it, after which it became a 2008 campaign issue for Obama, then was promulgated as a rule and political imperative, and that is where he thinks the issue "got off the rail."</i></blockquote>
Of course Powell ignores the fact that if he hadn't massively deregulated the broadband industry in the first place based on flimsy justifications and bad data, we likely wouldn't be having this conversation. Powell then continues with the idea that it's everybody <i>else's</i> fault for net neutrality becoming a partisan issue (like oh, claiming neutrality is "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20141115/07454429157/ted-cruz-doubles-down-misunderstanding-internet-net-neutrality-as-republican-engineers-call-him-out-ignorance.shtml">Obamacare for the Internet</a>"):
<blockquote><i>"Asked to make the "Republican" case for network neutrality, Powell said Republicans are "no different from Democrats in that they want their messages to be heard," and Republican kids want to go to Nickelodeon, and everybody wants to use their iPhone. These services and apps are not partisan, he said. It was the President's "interjection" into the issue that turned it into "party political partisanship," Powell said. </i></blockquote>
He's half right. As we've noted countless times, Democrats and Republicans alike <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20141112/11431629122/republicans-democrats-alike-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality-why-dont-gop-officials-congress-recognize-this.shtml">support net neutrality</a>, and a growing number of conservatives are supporting Title II because they realize it's the best available option in a market that's simply not going to be competitive any time soon. The difference is, if you back away from partisan pattycake for a moment, you'll notice that Powell's a <b>huge</b> part of the reason that competition doesn't exist. And as cable's top lobbyist he's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100217/1252148202.shtml">still busy pretending the industry's hyper competitive</a> while defending <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml">practices like unnecessary usage caps</a> -- directly aimed at abusing the lack of competition he helped facilitate.
<br/><br/>
Republican, Democrat or aardvark, it's unfortunate that nobody in this country appears particularly interested in somehow documenting and remembering what people have previously said and done; it might just come in handy sometime when trying to determine credibility.</div>

Late last night, people started buzzing on Twitter about the fact that Lenovo, makers of the famous Thinkpad laptops, had been installing a really nasty form of adware on those machines called Superfish. Many news stories started popping up about this, again, focusing on the adware. But putting adware on a computer, while ethically questionable and a general pain in the ass, is not the real problem here. The problem is that the adware in question, Superfish, has an astoundingly stupid way of working that effectively allows for a very easy <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/" target="_blank">man in the middle attack</a> on any computer with the software installed, making it a <i>massive</i> security hole that is <i>insanely dangerous</i>.
<br/><br/>
Lenovo's response? Basically <a href="http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1929" target="_blank">to shrug its shoulders</a> and say it doesn't understand why anyone's that upset. This is because whoever wrote Lenovo's statement on this is completely clueless about computer security.
<blockquote><i>
We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.
</i></blockquote>
Bullshit. That's really the only response that should be said to that line. Lenovo focuses on the reasons why many people normally hate adware: that it tracks what you're doing and sends info back to third parties. That's not what Superfish does, so Lenovo doesn't see what the big deal is. Superfish, which was just recently ranked <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/superfish/" target="_blank">64th</a> by Forbes in its list of "Most Promising American Companies," tries to watch what you're surfing, and when you see certain images, the service injects other offerings for similar (or the same) products. In theory, if one <i>chose</i> to use such a product, you could see why it could be useful. But automatically putting it on computers is a different thing all together.
<br/><br/>
The real <i>problem</i> is in how Superfish deals with HTTPS protected sites. Since, in theory, it shouldn't be able to see the images on those sites, it appears that Superfish came up with what it must have believed was a clever workaround: it just installs a root HTTPS certificate, that it <i>signs itself</i>, to pretend that any HTTPS page you're visiting is perfectly legitimate. For many years, we've pointed out why the HTTPS system with certificate authorities is open to a giant <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100325/0403568713.shtml">man in the middle attack</a> via any certificate authority willing to grant a fake certificate -- and here we basically have Lenovo enabling this questionable company to go hogwild with this exact kind of MITM attack. Basically, <i>EVERY SINGLE HTTPS SITE</i> that you visit was a victim of this kind of MITM attack -- solely for the purpose of interjecting Superfish ads. In fact, some have suggested it could apply to VPNs as well. Basically this is a massively dangerous security hole with wide ranging implications. And Lenovo says they don't see why.
<br/><br/>
And, even beyond that, it's implemented incredibly stupidly -- in a way that is ridiculously dangerous. That's because it appears that the private key use for the Superfish certificate is <a href="https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/568261470615527426" target="_blank"><i>the same</i></a> on basically every install of this software. And it didn't take very long at all for security folks, such as Robert Graham, to <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/02/extracting-superfish-certificate.html" target="_blank">crack the password</a>, meaning that it's now incredibly easy to get access to information someone <i>thinks</i> is encrypted. As Graham notes, the password is "komodia" which just so happens to <i>also</i> <a href="http://www.komodia.com/" target="_blank">be the name</a> of a company that "redirects" HTTPS traffic (for spying on kids and such).
<br/><br/>
This is <i>a massive</i> and ridiculous security threat, and Lenovo is <i>completely</i> brushing it off as nothing big. As many have noted, people have been complaining about the adware components of the software for months now, and Lenovo announced that it was <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-P-Y-and-Z-series/Lenovo-Pre-instaling-adware-spam-Superfish-powerd-by/m-p/1863174#M79882" target="_blank">stopping installs</a>, because some people didn't like the way the software created popups and such -- but with no mention of the massive security problems. And, even now, the company doesn't seem willing to admit to them.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, the company doesn't even seem willing to say what machines it installed them on, or provide people with instructions on how to protect themselves (simply uninstalling Superfish won't do it). This is a huge mess. I've personally been a <i>very</i> loyal Lenovo Thinkpad customer for years, having bought many, many laptops. In fact, just a couple months ago -- right in the middle of the period of when Superfish was being preloaded -- I bought a new Thinkpad laptop, though it <i>appears</i> that mine is not one that includes Superfish. Still, Lenovo created a huge and dangerous mess, and they don't seem to recognize it at all. This kind of fuck up is <i>much worse</i> than the whole Sony rootkit thing from a decade or so ago, and as with Sony then, Lenovo doesn't seem to have the slightest clue of just how badly it has put people at risk.
<br/><br/>
It doesn't take much to kill off tremendous goodwill and trust, and Lenovo may have just done so with it's pitiful reaction here. It's one thing for Lenovo to have made the stupid decision to install this kind of adware/bloatware. It's a second thing to not realize the security implications of it. However, it's another thing entirely, once it's been pointed out to Lenovo to then deny that this is a security risk. Lenovo screwed up big time here, and mostly in the way it's responded to the mess it created.</div>

When it comes to regulatory enforcement, agencies are often at a loss to try and spin actions as somehow being positive. Often such seizures are seen as petty and overreaching acts focusing on business protectionism or the shutting down threats to tax revenue (permanently in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner" target="_blank">some cases</a>) by regular people, meaning that getting public support for them can be an uphill struggle. Alcohol taxes are so unpopular that it's the origin behind one of the most popular sports in the US – NASCAR. Thus it's tempting to try and upsell things by stretching claims beyond all credulity, as the UK's Intellectual Property Office (IPO) and Department of Business, Innovation &#038; Skills (BIS) departments did recently.
<br/><br/>
Facebook followers of the IPO were confronted with this story just recently:
<center>
<a href="https://imgur.com/sdHY9sO"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sdHY9sO.png"/></a>
</center>
"Campaign cracks down on toxic fake alcohol" screams the headline, with the comment that thousands of liters were seized in Operation OPSON (a name that looks like it was short for "operation poison"). A serious bust of dangerous goods clearly, and clearly the agencies are doing a great job protecting the country, so share it and back to cat pictures.
<br/><br/>
Or you could actually read the article itself, and find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-cracks-down-on-toxic-fake-alcohol" target="_blank">the story isn't quite as portrayed</a>, and no cyanide-filled bottles cosplaying as spirituous liquors were annihilated by brave officials. For that matter, not only is OPSON not a veiled reference to poison, it's not even a priority. At the head of "notes to editors," Operation OPSON is described quite differently:
<blockquote><i>
"Operation OPSON, jointly run by Interpol and Europol, began in 2011 to tackle the criminal production and sale of counterfeit 'protected food name' products, such as gorgonzola or champagne. It is now an international project that regularly sees the seizure of hundreds of tonnes of fake and substandard food."
</i></blockquote>
That's right, international police agencies are running an operation to seize food not because they are bad, dangerous, or harmful, but because they weren't made in an approved locale. While some are fairly evident and obvious, such as lamb or beef labelled "scotch" or "welsh," others are less-so. A Cornish pasty made in Devon or Derbyshire isn't actually a Cornish pasty, because it wasn't made in Cornwall. Likewise if you were to make Feta cheese, you can't actually call it Feta, unless the sheep/goat milk came from Greece. Even Belgium has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130329/06083122509/belgium-we-want-to-be-champagne-chocolate.shtml">wanted in</a> on the act for its chocolate industry.
<br/><br/>
The food is fake (and presumed sub-standard) not because it's not that food, but because the place that made it wasn't within a certain circle on a map, even if it's absolutely identical and indistinguishable from the same product made inside that circle. This was never more evident than in 2007, when the protections around "Newcastle Brown Ale" were lifted… because the Scottish &#038; Newcastle brewery wanted to move outside the circle.
<br/><br/>
But what of the toxic alcohol seized by the gallon? Well, like the goods themselves, it's not what it appears. The 2,421.5 liters grabbed by authorities are in their own words mostly "...for fake or fiscal infringing wines and spirits." Not because they were dangerous, but because of tax evasion, or trademark violations. So where's the "toxic" issue in the headline?
<br/><br/>
The poison comes from a raid in Derbyshire, where:
<blockquote><i>
"There was little of the finished product or the raw materials (Coolex screenwash) in the unit but a large quantity of bottles, tops and boxes."
</i></blockquote>
Never mind, because:
<blockquote><i>
"A small amount of the finished product was identified, and on examination was found to contain high levels of iso-propanol. Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) causes intense drunkenness, is often used in cleaning chemicals."
</i></blockquote>
The question is, was that actually the finished product, or one that was put aside because it had those high levels? Moreover, it's not exactly the most toxic, as the LD50 (lethal dose) for a rat orally is <a href="https://www.fishersci.ca/viewmsds.do?catNo=A51620&#038;lang=en" target="_blank">5045 mg per kilogram</a>. Compare with, say, ethanol ("good" alcohol), at <a href="http://www.fishersci.com/ecomm/servlet/msdsproxy?productName=BP28184" target="_blank">3450 mg per kilogram</a> of mouse. Probably why even their expert, Visiting Professor at the University of Reading, Tony Hines had to say:
<blockquote><i>
"...even at low levels, a 'couple of doubles' will cause dizziness, low blood pressure, abdominal pain and nausea."
</i></blockquote>
Not exactly "toxic" though, or all that different from regular booze, let's be fair. In fact, the major difference is that isopropyl alcohol is just more potent than ethanol. So, to drive home the seriousness of this, they close with the following paragraph.
<blockquote><i>
"In 2012, methanol poisoning from fake vodka resulted in the deaths of 50 people in the Czech Republic. In 2014, 2 men were sentenced to life imprisonment for their part in this tragedy, and many others sentenced to 14 to 20 years for their part. Eighty survivors were blinded as a result of consuming the poison."
</i></blockquote>
Not to be flippant about it (the incident has killed 51), but this was an incident that happened 30 months ago 1500 km away. It even used a different chemical (methanol), so its inclusion is completely irrelevant to the issues at hand, and is there solely to try and justify tax and trademark-based raids and seizures as being about safety, and pump up the "shareability" factor by giving them a excuse to hang "toxic" in the headline.
<br/><br/>
Now, don't get me wrong, tainted and unsafe goods are bad, there's no doubt about that. Yet if you're going to try and play up a safety angle, then you really have to have a safety problem to hang your hat on. The vodka made from screenwash might be disturbing to some, but "toxic fake alcohol" is pushing it, when even if every drop of vodka they seized (171.1 liters) that year were high in isopropyl alcohol, it's only 7% of the total seized. And yet we know they didn't grab anywhere near that amount, because more than 240 bottles of the stuff is hardly "little of the finished product," a description which would seem to me to indicate a dozen liters or less. And since they found only empties, it means it's already gone out, so they've not really "cracked down" on it either.
<br/><br/>
Overall, the only toxic thing seems to be the press release, and then only for any journalist sloppy enough to regurgitate it without bothering to read it. That's probably why, on Twitter, where pushback, feedback and replies are harder to bury, there's absolutely <a href="https://twitter.com/The_IPO/status/567358496706789376" target="_blank">no mention of "toxic" at all</a>.
<br/><br/>
That's because when it comes to poisonous, nothing beats hyperbolic government press releases for leaving good will stone dead.</div>

<p>
Attorney General Holder <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/02/risen-obama-admin-is-greatest-enemy-of-press-freedom-202707.html?hp=c2_3">raised some eyebrows</a> earlier this week when answering a question about his Justice Department's notorious crackdown on leaks, and by extension the press, most notably saying this about its notorious pursuit of New York Times reporter James Risen, while claiming the DOJ did nothing wrong:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
<p>
If you look at the last case involving Mr. Risen, the way in which that case was handled after the new policies were put in place [is] an example of how the Justice Department can proceed.
</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
The District Sentinel <a href="https://www.districtsentinel.com/obama-administration-lenient-on-whistleblowers-and-leakers-holder-claims/">aptly</a> took apart most of Holder's comments, and they also provoked a stinging rebuke from <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/02/risen-obama-admin-is-greatest-enemy-of-press-freedom-202707.html?hp=c2_3">Risen himself last night</a> on Twitter. However, I think the facts of Risen's case deserve a closer look to see just how unbelievable Holder's statement is.
</p>
<p>
Let's recap: since the very start of the Obama administration (read: for SIX years), the Justice Department was trying to subpoena James Risen. It fought for him to testify at a grand jury of CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, which he refused to do, and when they were rejected by the court, it fought to have him testify in Sterling's trial. They fought Risen on this all the way up to the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
Also, keep in mind, while the "new" media/leak guidelines that Holder bragged about are certainly a step forward, the old guidelines that applied to Risen's case should have protected him just the same from the start—if they were actually enforced. He doesn't get to pretend the preceding five and a half years didn't happen just because he stregthened the Justice Department's rules after public protest.
</p>
<p>
The case cost Risen and his publisher an untold fortune in legal fees, dominated his life, took away from time he could've spent reporting, and likely cost the taxpayers millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, we found out that the government <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/50168.html">had spied on virtually every aspect</a> of James Risen's digital life from phone calls, to emails, to credit card statements, bank records and more. (By the way, we still have no idea how they got this information. That's secret.)
</p>
<p>
The Justice Department <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesRisen/status/567893786606600193">argued in court</a> that not only was there no reporter's privilege whatsoever -- either embedded in the First Amendment or in Fourth Circuit common law -- but also that journalists protecting sources <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/13/obama-administration-jail-james-risen">was analogous</a> to protecting drug dealers from prosecution.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the Justice Department got an appeals court to <a href="https://freedom.press/blog/2013/07/court-guts-reporters-privilege-one-most-significant-press-freedom-cases-decades">destroy the previously established reporter's privilege in the Fourth Circuit</a>. So now all journalists in the Fourth Circuit -- which covers Virginia and Maryland where the vast majority of national security sources live and work -- will have no protection if the government comes after them in future cases.
</p>
<p>
<em>After all this </em>(along with a large public outcry), the government decided to drop its pursuit of James Risen. And of course were able to easily convict Jeffrey Sterling anyways, using evidence gleaned from digital surveillance.
</p>
<p>
Now the Justice Department wants a pat on the back. While it is unequivocally excellent news that Risen will not be forced into jail, the DOJ's behavior in this case was and still is deplorable. It has done damage to long-term press freedom rights that will be very hard to undo, and the idea that this should be looked at as a "model" for future leak investigations is troubling to say the least.

If you've followed the net neutrality discussion here in the U.S. since the beginning, you'll recall the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20140901/16294128388/everything-youve-wanted-to-know-about-net-neutrality-were-afraid-to-ask.shtml">debate began in earnest</a> back in 2005 when then AT&#038;T CEO Ed Whitacre declared that Google should pay an extra, arbitrary toll simply for using the AT&#038;T network. By Whitacre's government-pampered, duopolist logic, any content company that so much as touches an ISP's network should pay a levy to offset infrastructure costs -- well -- just because. Soon, a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060801/0219252.shtml">seemingly endless</a> array of hired <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081204/1453233022.shtml">telco flacks</a> started telling anybody who'd listen that content companies were getting a "free ride" and really needed to start paying their "fair share."
<br/><br/>
As we've <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100412/0111098965.shtml">repeatedly explained</a> (perhaps unnecessarily if you have anything resembling critical thinking skills), this reasoning is incoherent and stupid, since customers and content companies alike already pay plenty for bandwidth and infrastructure. Still, somehow Whitacre's absurd attempt to try and offload network operation costs to others went viral globally, and we've repeatedly seen overseas telcos trying to argue the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100209/0309058094.shtml">same point</a> ever since. Of course, whereas Google used to be the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100209/0309058094.shtml">global telco whipping boy</a>, we're increasingly seeing Netflix playing that role given its more vocal support of net neutrality.
<br/><br/>
It's the painfully dumb idea that just won't die. French Minister of Culture and Communication Fleur Pellerin has spent the last few years with an <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414014,00.asp">incumbent telco bug in her ear</a>, demanding that she force Google, Netflix and other content companies to pay some kind of a "bandwidth tax." As we've seen here in the States, Google appeared willing to (at least temporarily) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20150129/05182929846/google-finally-stops-playing-mute-net-neutrality-says-new-rules-wont-hurt-google-fiber-slightest.shtml">go mute</a> on net neutrality, and as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20130123/11101721766/google-decides-smartphone-market-share-is-more-important-than-net-neutrality.shtml">Glyn has noted previously</a>, Google France appeared willing to trample neutrality principles, allowing some degree of ISP double dipping to protect mobile handset market share.
<br/><br/>
Apparently feeling encouraged, Pellerin has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/11/french_minister_hit_google_facebook_apple_netflix_et_al_with_bandwidth_tax/">ramped up her efforts</a> for this new content company tax in order to "level the playing field" for French TV and filmmakers (read: incumbent French phone company Orange):<blockquote><i>"France's culture minister is as keen as ever to tax tech behemoths to "level the playing field" for French TV and filmmakers. According to news reports, Fleur Pellerin plans to introduce a new tax on "the use of bandwidth", although exactly how this will be calculated is not clear...In January, the minister said she wanted a "level playing field "for French broadcasters alongside the likes of Netflix. The news was welcomed by some ISPs who want to offer so-called specialised services – basically incorporating lots more speed and bandwidth."</i></blockquote>As a general rule of thumb, I've found that almost anytime somebody claims to be interested in "leveling the playing field," they're usually busy trying to do the exact opposite. There's still no details on precisely how Pellerin's plan would work, but it's likely going to run face-first into the EU's looming net neutrality rules, which, if they're worth anything, will at the very least ban these kinds of ridiculous "troll tolls." Here in the States, most phone companies have been forced to shift their attention from ham-fisted troll tolls to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20150106/12150529611/despite-limited-interest-ats-sponsored-data-company-still-bullish-its-awful-precedent.shtml">more subtle, clever ways of abusing market power</a>, whether that's interconnection, usage caps or zero rated apps.
<br/><br/>
Still, Ed Whitacre's viral meme that phone companies have the inherent, god-given right to double or triple dip is the gift that just keeps on giving.</div>

As Techdirt has been warning for some time, one of the dangers with the flood of "anti-terrorist" laws and powers is that they are easily redirected against other groups for very different purposes. A story in the Globe and Mail provides <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/anti-petroleum-movement-a-growing-security-threat-to-canada-rcmp-say/article23019252/">another chilling reminder of how that works</a>:
<i><blockquote>The RCMP [<a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/index-eng.htm">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>] has labelled the "anti-petroleum" movement as a growing and violent threat to Canada's security, raising fears among environmentalists that they face increased surveillance, and possibly worse, under the Harper government's new terrorism legislation.</blockquote></i>
As the Globe and Mail article makes clear, environmentalists are now being considered as part of an "anti-petroleum" movement. That's not just some irrelevant rebranding: it means that new legislation supposedly targeting "terrorism" can be applied.
<i><blockquote>The legislation identifies "activity that undermines the security of Canada" as anything that interferes with the economic or financial stability of Canada or with the country's critical infrastructure, though it excludes lawful protest or dissent. And it allows the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service to take measures to reduce what it perceives to be threats to the security of Canada.</blockquote></i>
Clearly, that's an incredibly broad definition, and would apply to just about any environmental or social movement -- especially since even the most peaceful protests are often considered "illegal." That, in its turn would allow Canada's security agencies to collect information on these groups, and "disrupt" them.
What's also troubling about the leaked RCMP "intelligence assessment" that forms the source for the Globe and Mail story is the very clear political position it seems to be taking on fossil fuels and climate change:
<i><blockquote>The report extolls the value of the oil and gas sector to the Canadian economy, and adds that many environmentalists "claim" that climate change is the most serious global environmental threat, and "claim" it is a direct consequence of human activity and is "reportedly" linked to the use of fossil fuels.</blockquote></i>
That sounds more like something that would come from the oil and gas industries' marketing departments, rather than from a country's impartial police force. However, as Techdirt has reported before, the current Canadian government has been <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130420/07463322778/after-muzzling-librarians-scientists-now-canada-starts-making-it-difficult-citizens-to-express-their-views.shtml">muzzling</a> other groups that dare to disagree with its policies, especially on climate change, for some time. Redefining environmentalists as anti-petroleum extremists is clearly part of the same repressive approach.

Although <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=arduino">Arduino</a> has figured a few times here on Techdirt in the DailyDirt section, it's not very well-known outside the world of open hardware, where it was one of the pioneers (its reference designs are distributed under a CC-BY-SA license, and all of its software under the GNU GPL or LGPL). One sad sign that Arduino has arrived is that there is currently a falling out between some of the founders (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/economia-digitale/15_febbraio_10/pasticcio-arduino-guerra-fondatori-banzi-martino-7eee04d2-b11a-11e4-9c01-b887ba5f55e9.shtml">original in Italian</a>), partly over the rising monetary stakes involved.
<br/><br/>
The Italian company set up by one founder, Gianluca Martino, has been the main supplier of Arduino products for years -- the open hardware license allows others to make them, too, but not to claim that they are "official." Originally called Smart Projects, it has now renamed itself Arduino Srl, and taken on a new CEO with the aim of growing sales and taking the company public in a few years' time. That hasn't gone down too well with perhaps the best-known of the founders, Massimo Banzi, who oversees the development of the whole Arduino project, and heads up the Swiss-based company Arduino Sa, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/economia-digitale/15_febbraio_10/pasticcio-arduino-guerra-fondatori-banzi-martino-7eee04d2-b11a-11e4-9c01-b887ba5f55e9.shtml">the main Arduino Llc, registered in Massachusetts</a>.
<br/><br/>
Alongside the original Arduino site <a href="http://arduino.cc/">arduino.cc</a>, Martino's company has now created <a href="http://arduino.org/">arduino.org</a>, with a similar color scheme, and the motto "the adventure continues." Both Martino and Banzi say they are discussing partnerships with other manufacturers -- Martino with Bosch and Panasonic, Banzi with Intel -- with a view to selling more Arduino boards around the world (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/economia-digitale/15_febbraio_13/arduino-verita-banzi-e780b49a-b363-11e4-8ea5-42a1b52c991f.shtml">original in Italian</a>). Inevitably, perhaps, the two factions are fighting each other in lawsuits.
<br/><br/>
However those suits are decided, it seems possible that there will be some kind of fork of Arduino, with the two rival camps claiming to be the true heirs of the original project. That's <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/153135">common enough in the world of open source software</a>, but this will probably be the first time it has happened in the open hardware field.

I guess if you're going to engage in a stupid, neverending "war," <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/02/12/judge-tosses-16-kilos-of-meth-evidence.htm" target="_blank">the most honest way to approach it is stupidly</a>.
<blockquote>
<i>Sixteen kilos of methamphetamine the Border Patrol found in an SUV was struck from the record by a federal judge because the agents didn't get the driver's consent to X-ray the vehicle.</i>
</blockquote>
The CBP had two suspects exactly where it wanted them: detained by agents at a checkpoint. And the longer they were detained, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1660459/usa-complaint-hernandez.pdf" target="_blank">the more nervous they got</a>. Despite a search of the interior turning up nothing and the drug-sniffing dogs failing to alert, the CBP officers were pretty sure they had just captured two smugglers. So, the agents routed the vehicle through their backscatter X-ray scanner, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1660458/suppression-order-hernandez.pdf" target="_blank">skipping a step in the process</a>.
<blockquote>
<i>Agent Buchanan testified that he did not rely on probable cause for the backscatter search, but rather on consent to search given by Defendants. He testified, &ldquo;<b>we always ask for consent for the backscatter . . . unless we&rsquo;ve already found something in the vehicle</b>.&rdquo; He testified that he typically has another agent get consent to search the vehicle with the backscatter. <b>Agent Buchanan was unable to identify the agent he asked to get consent from the Defendants and was unable to confirm that such consent was requested</b>.</i>
</blockquote>
So, Buchanan was unable to come up with any evidence <i>or</i> probable cause, but decided to perform the backscatter anyway, despite his doing so being completely contradicted by his portrayal of the CBP's standard m.o. This wasn't the only contradictory statement in the CBP's testimony.
<blockquote>
<i>Agent Valdez, who remained in the secondary waiting area with the Defendants, <b>testified that he was present when Defendants gave consent</b> to the backscatter search. <b>However, he was unable to identify the agent who requested consent, how the request was phrased, and how the Defendants replied</b>.</i>
</blockquote>
Valdez, despite being "present," couldn't actually say whether the defendants had given consent (or who to), but went ahead and told the court that the two men had consented.
<br/><br/>
The backscatter device -- an additional search that required consent or a warrant -- uncovered 14 wrapped packages of meth, 16 kilograms in all. From that Fourth Amendment-skirting search, the CBP compiled its criminal complaint. Now, all of that narrative is nearly useless, thanks to these officers' actions.
<br/><br/>
The court, on its way to dismissing as evidence the 16 kilos of meth obtained that day, points out the government's contradictory statements, as well as its inability to find <i>anyone</i> to corroborate the multiple claims that permission for the search had been granted.
<blockquote>
<i>Defendants argue that Border Patrol agents did not request their consent to search the vehicle with a backscatter. Agent Buchanan testified that he asked another Border Patrol agent to obtain that consent, but he was unable to identify the agent and was unable to confirm that the agent requested consent. Although Agent Valdez testified that he was present when Defendants gave consent for the backscatter search, he was unable to recall which agent requested consent and what was said by the agent and the Defendants. <b>More importantly, the Government failed to identify and to offer the testimony of the agent who purportedly sought and obtained the consent</b>.</i>
</blockquote>
And away goes 16 kilos of evidence, along with the bust itself, most likely. Kind of hard to prove the defendants were smuggling drugs when you can't introduce the smuggled drugs in court. Everyone at this particular CBP checkpoint apparently felt someone else would handle the consent issue. And even if the agents had been rebuffed, it's not as though the detainees were free to go. A warrant could have been acquired, most likely with minimal effort.
<br/><br/>
This isn't a huge bust nor would it have put a significant dent in a drug lord's operation. The CBP only had a couple of guys who had muled themselves out for a few hundred dollars. That, in and of itself, is just one of the problems with this nation's drug war. Thousands of tiny arrests like these happen <i>every day</i> and the "problem" isn't anywhere closer to being "solved."
<br/><br/>
The other thing this incident is symptomatic of is our nation's law enforcement agencies' <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110518/17015914326/what-4th-amendment-indiana-sheriff-says-random-warrantless-house-to-house-searches-are-okay.shtml" target="_blank">extremely casual relationship</a> with the Fourth Amendment. Time after time, we see the government (national and local) doing everything it can to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20130819/18571524246/administration-keeps-chipping-away-fourth-amendment-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-warrantless-cell-phone-searches.shtml" target="_blank">avoid obtaining warrants</a> -- whether it's their tendency to ask dogs for "permission" to perform warrantless searches or officers themselves using everything from imperceptible whiffs of drug odors to declaring every sign of nervousness as tantamount to a full confession. "Probable cause" is a low bar, but law enforcement agencies seem willing to sidestep it with alarming regularity. The CBP had a car full of drugs and two suspects nailed, but it showed that its "respect" for the Fourth Amendment was just a formality. Now, it has nothing more than two men suspected of smuggling the same drugs that can't be used against them in a court of law.</div>
