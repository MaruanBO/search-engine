    <p>FreedomDonations.com is a web-based communications, development and fundraising consulting and services group that provides a full menu of online computer programming, data processing, financial support and fiscal reporting services designed for not-for-profit, political and other conservative citizen organizations. We provide experienced professionals to assist our clients in crafting effective email and social media messaging; soliciting membership, activism and contributions; and receiving pledges and donations over the Internet safely and securely with their own organizational landing pages, via a simple but highly secure online transactions procedure fully facilitated by our professional system.</p>
    <p>Our services help ensure that activist support and donation pledges on behalf of our client not-for-profit organizations are solicited, processed, acknowledged and reported in accord with the myriad of state and federal privacy, banking, tax and election laws and regulations with which many small and start-up non-profits struggle to comply.  Our services interface with our clients' own merchant accounts, and they may select cafeteria-style from our many professional offerings. Whether acting as full-service registered fundraising consultants, or providing services on a boutique basis, Freedom Donations is responsible for seeing that all communications and funds directed to our client groups and causes are securely routed to and received by the organization designated in each online contact through FreedomDonations.com.</p>
