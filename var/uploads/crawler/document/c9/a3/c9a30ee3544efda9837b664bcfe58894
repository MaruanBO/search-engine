I have suffered back pain for over 20 years with pinched nerves in my hips and lower back. (I am 46) I have tried every remedy you mention in your site and all of them really did not keep the pain away - just barely got me mobile. I have been doing the exercises 2-3 times daily for Forward Tipped Pelvis and the Sciatica stretches for over a month now and I have not gone to the Chiropractor and I am virtually pain free. I ride Performance Horses in Competition and I cannot tell you how good I now feel being able to concentrate on riding and not my back pain. THANK-YOU!!!!

<p>Your system has not only improved my pain 150%, but also has helped other areas that were not evident as being problematic. I took the self-assessment and really understood the full aspect of all of my back related issues.

I have tried everything to make it go away... chiropractic, physical therapy, acupuncture, etc. with various successes at different times. Last October, I ended up in the emergency room in such agony that I was given morphine to control the pain; I was admitted to the hospital and had an MRI the next day. I was scheduled for emergency surgery and <strong>had laminectomy on L4-L5 and on L5-S1</strong> levels of my spine. I was greatly relieved to have my leg pain gone and was finally pain free! </p>
<p>After approximately six weeks of recovery, I went to the neurosurgeon for my post-operative review and was told to resume exercising to strengthen my back and was given a generic set of exercises to start with. Within three days, my leg pain had returned. I was devastated! Long story short, I started doing my own research and that's how I  found your site. I was interested in the fact that your approach would target the cause of my leg pain and would tailor exercises to help my particular problem. I figured I would try your system instead of the P.T. program I was following without much relief. </p>
<p>I received the video and manual within a few days and started right in; I did the assessments and found that I needed the exercises for pelvis tipped forward, right hip high, and for sciatica. <strong>My leg pain started to improve within a week</strong>; in fact, so much so that I could cut back on the pills within a few days and stopped taking them all together within another week! My improvement steadily continued within the next few weeks. I am now pretty much <strong>pain free for the first time in over five</strong> <strong>years</strong>. I really wish I had found your program five years ago...it may have saved me several thousands of dollars and years of pain! However, at this point I can only be glad to have found it when I did. I hope that others find your program when they initially have back or leg pain. I have never done a testimonial for any other product. Then again, I have never tried a program that made such a difference as yours has for me. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/arthritisbook.php" title="Read more about Arthritis Reversed">Read more about Arthritis Reversed<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

He sent me to a physio and put me on muscle relaxants, neither of one made any improvement. I searched the Internet for more information and found your web page and liked your approach. When I received your program I also liked the way you have to identify the problem and then treat it. Some of the exercises were the same as the Physio gave me but most were not and I was confident they would all work together to rid me of that terrible agony. In the fall of 2005 I had booked a ski trip to Aspen for the last week of March and was reluctant to cancel it although in January I knew it would be impossible. By the first of February I was feeling some improvement and put the skis on mid February and was absolutely astounded that I could ski without any pain. I was able to go to Aspen and enjoyed a great week of skiing. I still have some numbness in my foot that my doctor tells me is nerve damage but should go away in time. I hope will never experience that pain again, but if I do, I will know exactly where to go for help. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/arthritisbook.php" title="Read more about Arthritis Reversed">Read more about Arthritis Reversed<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

Since March of 2004, I have had symptoms that I can only compare to having been kicked in the behind by a mule. That pain in the butt then took off toward my ankle and made standing or walking a living torture. I started with chiropractic, then orthopedic surgeons, then physical therapists, then massage therapy, more orthopods, anti-inflamatories,and lost all hope for ever recovering.Then an internet search took me to your website, and ever skeptical, I was desperate. Less than a week later, I watched your DVD, read the manual, and determined my course of action (still skeptical, of course); Two weeks later, I THOUGHT I was feeling a little better ( maybe a placebo effect). One Month later, my pain had decreased by 50 %. It is now just over two months into the program, and I can honestly, and amazingly, say that <strong>I am 98% pain free</strong>. I honestly do not believe it, but truth is beauty, as the poet said. Why NO certified practitioner had been able to truly diagnose and isolate the problem, and the CURE, I will never know.

<p>Lose Your Back Pain is a superior product that cuts through the core of suffering so many people have. The exercises and the way you've put them into an easy-to-follow program  work like magic. Your program holds the keys that will not only help eliminate back pain, but may even keep thousands of people out of the doctor's office - other than for brief check-ups. People who have suffered with back pain for years will find relief with your program. I should know because I've seen these exercises work wonders for young and not-so-young.

<p align="left">"As a pharmacist with a keen interest in natural supplements I can safely say I've seen it all. But for patients with pain - who are looking for an answer outside of dangerous prescription medications - I have only a handful of recommendations. Heal-n-Soothe® is on that short list.</p>
<p>It's not only as effective as prescription anti-inflammatories, but is much safer. And, unlike other supplements on the market, Heal-n-Soothe® really is free of any fillers or colorants. It truly is all natural.</p>
<p>The point is this: if you're sitting on the fence about other options to treat your pain you owe it to yourself to give Heal-n-Soothe® a fair shot.

<p align="left">I've had orthopedic problems since I was 7 years old. I figured up that over the last 31 years (I'm 38 now), I've had a total of 14 surgeries---6 of them knee surgeries and 1 foot surgery---plus a broken pelvis and sprained SI joint from a past car accident.</p>
<p align="left">After the foot surgery 10 years ago, the doctor decided I would benefit from taking Celebrex.</p>
<p align="left">Recently, after being diagnosed with severe arthritis in one knee and moderate arthritis in my foot, the doctor doubled my dosage of Celebrex. I couldn't discern any improvement on the new dosage. Also, I began getting concerned about the possibility of the prolonged usage of this drug causing liver damage.<br /> <br />I have now been taking Heal-n-Soothe® for 30 days, and I feel the same as I did while taking the double dosage of Celebrex.</p>
<p>I have hope that after more time on Heal-n-Soothe®, I will feel even better---and I like that right now I'm getting at least the same, if not yet better, anti-inflammatory effect from natural enzymes, rather than from a chemical that could potentially harm my liver.<br /> <br /> Thanks so much! <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inflammation5.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a>

<p>  Thank you for spending so much time with me on the phone the other day. What a great service you provide for those of us struggling with chronic back pain.  I could hear true concern and compassion in your voice.</p>
<p>  As we discussed, chronic pain is one of the most debilitating things a person can encounter in his or her life. It can consume you and disrupts the ability to function at even minimal levels both physically and mentally and even emotionally as time passes.</p>
<p>  I suffer with disc problems that has led to excruciating sciatic pain that at times has left me unable to walk or sit at all. Just laying still was unbearably painful. I have tried many modalities in an effort to "cure" this condition. What I have found is that the most helpful thing I can do is to consistently do the exercises that help with proper body alignment and muscle functioning that you have outlined in your Lose The Back Pain Program.</p>
<p>  I look forward to the addition of the Heal-n-Soothe™ products to further help restore my health. I am sure it will be a great help in my recovery.</p>
<p>  Thank you so much for your dedication to helping those who are in need. You have a great program that will benefit the many people who are truly at the end of their rope and feel they have no where else to turn for help. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inflammation5.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inflammation5.html" title="Read more about Heal-n-Soothe">Read more about Heal-n-Soothe<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

<p>It is about a month now since I started with Heal-n-Soothe™ and the pain I had in my lower back has gone.  I am able to walk without leaning on something.  I feel much better and I thank you for introducing this product to me.  I tried several products and pain pills but nothing did work like Heal-n-Soothe™.

Steve spent considerable time with me answering my questions and offering suggestions.</p>
<p>I "get it" because of the considerable research you put into both the enzymes and the muscle imbalance issue. Once I reviewed the books and DVD's, did my assessment and began the stretches, it occurred to me that this is the most common sense approach to healing my body. Why do so many of the professionals not "get it"?</p>
<p>I had convinced myself that taking Celebrex may cause side effects which could endanger my life, but was willing to take the risk for the sake of "quality of life". I am happy to report I no longer take Celebrex, once the only drug that would allow me to function "normally" by blocking the pain. The Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus reduces the inflammation to a point where I can now look forward to a productive day, plan trips and live with about 80% less pain. I am currently working on the other 20% as I gradually, at my own pace, address the muscle imbalances and do the stretches as recommended in the Lose the Back Pain System.</p>
<p>I now apply what I have learnt about muscles imbalances on a daily basis to avoid triggering spasms.</p>
<p>It took me 4 and half years of trial and error before I found your website. Another 2 months of procrastination, scepticism, and reading your articles and newsletters before I finally decided to order the Lose The Back Pain System and the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus. So glad I did, wish I had done it sooner!</p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks Jesse and Steve. I hope you continue to help others as you have helped me.</p>
<p>P.S. Love the new website, great articles in the treatment section.</p>

<p>Thank You for all the Emails you have been sending me since I enrolled in the "Lose The Back Pain System"</p>
<p>I also purchased the Heal-n-Soothe™ Capsules at the very Welcome Price!</p>
<p>I stopped taking all NSAIDS Immediately (which I have been taking for five years) and started taking the Heal-n-Soothe™ Capsules - To my delight about half the burning sensations in the front and sides of my shins disappeared by the second day of use.</p>
<p>The awful debilitating Cramps in my Calves and Feet ceased almost altogether - Leaving me now to contend with ' Only ' Sciatica in my right buttock and leg - numbness in both my feet and toes and pains in the soles of my feet and heels, like standing on Golf Balls - which in itself is a Great improvement - So I will continue with a further course of the Heal-n-Soothe™ Capsules :-)</p>
<p>We have enjoyed Every moment of the Video and Audio and the Emails and also the Further Links - Our heads are Spinning - with glee at the prospect of Help may yet be at hand !! </p>
<p><strong>Best Wish to You All!</strong></p>

<p>Cut the story short I tried to go for acupuncture and acupressure to a Chinese clinic who told me that I had slip disc and that I should rest and lie down on hard mattress or risk never walking again. I had 6 sessions already but no relief. I still have not gone for my next 2 session as these buggers have taken money in advance for 8 sessions.</p>
<p>My doctor also prescribed me stronger anti inflammatory drugs to take which i was not looking forward to.</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with the diagnosis so I decided to surf the net and saw few other product and finally found your site and read the report and I was quite convinced that I will kill the pain before it kills me.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning with severe pain and was feeling a bit panic'd. I was in agony with the pain in my right leg so i took the painkillers to get my focus back and was waiting to hear from your office regarding my access link. Finally I got your email, I was very pleased and I spent the whole afternoon like a good student reading all the materials, listening to all the audios and watching the videos.</p>
<p>After doing all that, I knew what was wrong with me and I tried the stretches as shown on the video and felt the immediate relief and pain was reduced by about 40 percent in the first hour and now after six hours I am almost 80% pain free. I don’t feel the pressure on my hamstring and my pelvis joint anymore although there is some soreness due to the length of time i was in pain which will probably disappear in a day or too.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the outcome and thanks to Steve, Bobby, Jesse  and the rest of the team for their best efforts and continued further development.</p>
<p><strong>Keep up the good work! Cheers...</strong></p>

<p>Recurring back pain from previous soccer seasons affected me again in August when I began my Fall soccer season. At first I was playing through the pain and then I started taking Heal-n-Soothe™. Within the first week I noticed a significant decrease in the amount of pain I felt.</p>
<p>I have been taking them now for nearly two months and over the course of these two months my back pain has subsided to almost nothing and I have been able to continue playing soccer all season. I truly believe that Heal-n-Soothe™ has enabled me to get to where I am today which is playing pain-free.</p>

I have continued them twice daily every day since. I also ordered and started taking the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus as soon as it arrived. In the 4 weeks since I started the stretches, I have achieved about 90% relief from my right hip pain caused by a degenerated disc at L5-S1, as found by an MRI and Xrays last August. </p>
<p>I visited a chiropractor for over 10 months last year for "manipulations" and about 18 sessons of treatment on a DRX-9000. My chiro referred me to have Micro surgery last November that did not decrease my hip pain, and as it got worse, the Ortho doctor my surgeon referred me to told me that I needed more "agressive" surgery than I had received to correct my back problem, and that my hip itself was just fine.</p>
<p>I have not seen any doctors during this 4 weeks, and I have done nothing else to attribute my improvement to except your system and the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus. I only wish I had found your system 2 years ago when this hip pain first appeared, and I believe that I could have avoided the surgery and all the expenses of seeing chiropractors and ortho doctors completely.</p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inflammation5.html" title="Read more about Heal-n-Soothe">Read more about Heal-n-Soothe<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

It finally caught up with me and I started having debilitating sciatica pain.

Chiropractic and physical therapy helped a little but not enough to get me through the pain. It was so bad I couldn't sleep at night.

After doing your exercises for sciatica, and using the Rub On Relief® and far infrared heating pad religiously, the pain is gone. If it acts up again I just pull out the heating pad and do my exercises.

No more "pain pills" for me!"

I have suffered 
from neck and back injuries for over 10 years. I have several bulging discs, bone spurs, stenosis and 
arthritis in both my neck and lower back.

The many combinations of medications and various injections were the only sources of relief I had 
until I purchased the heating pad from the Healthy Back Institute. I have owned several heating pads 
throughout the years and while the heat helped ease the pain, the effects were short-lived. The relief I get from this heating pad lasts for hours. 

I am able to move around much easier and perform the normal household work like vacuuming and 
mopping that I was told to avoid.  Every morning before work and every evening after work, I spend 1/2 
hour to an hour on the heating pad and get immediate relief from my lower back pain and then I use it on my neck and shoulders at the end of the day to relieve the tension built up from working on a computer all day. 

I am so pleased with this product and have recommended it to many of my friends. Thanks to it, I am 
able to be more active and have a better quality of life.

Peace Love Light

<h3>Pain Free For The First Time That I Can Remember...</h3>
<p></center></p>
<p>My wife bought me your inversion chair quite a few months ago because of back pain I have suffered most of my life. I thought it was probably just another one of those things you spend money on, but they</p>
<p>don’t do you any good. After reading your newsletters and watching your videos I decided to give it a try. After about a week I noticed that my back didn't hurt anymore and I can say that I am virtually <strong>pain free for the first time that I can remember.</strong> </p>
<p> I would like to thank you very much for opening my eyes to a system that really does work like you say it does. I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate what you have done for me by making me aware of the benefits of inversion therapy. Thank you again and I will be reading your newsletters regularly for all the benefits they (you) provide. Forever grateful!" <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inversion3.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p>

<p>"After doing my own research I came upon your site and the suggestion of an inversion table. Reading the literature for inversion all made a lot of sense to me, and for what I paid for three visits to the chiropractor (since the insurance did not cover this) I had myself an inversion table. I used it as recommended and started out at about 45 degrees for two weeks each day for 10 to 15 minutes right before bed.</p>
<p>After two weeks I was a little better and I was ready to go fully inverted, which I did for another month 10 to 15 minutes almost each day right before bed.</p>
<p><strong>After that month I was 100% better. I could not believe the results</strong></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>oday I tell everyone of <strong>this wonderful table that has given me my life back</strong>, as I enjoy volleyball and softball at my age of 51.</p>
<p>The pain used to be so bad, sitting was the worst and what really scared me was the fact that my left foot tingled almost continuously. I thought for sure surgery was going to be once again the only solution. I am so thankful for your site and the information that you provide so people like me can get relief from one of the worst types of everyday pain one can experience. Today I use the table as a relaxation and stretch after a workout or a sport activity, which is usually 3-4 times per week. I would never give it up and will certainly use it the rest of my life. I now do crunches using the table and the results really show. Thank you again for a wonderful product that really works as advertised."</p>

I have 4 issues going on. Without all the fancy terms - I have an "S" curved spine, a slipped vertebrae (class 2) a budging disc - lower back and some stenosis.</p>
<p>I've had a bad time with Sciatica, hip, butt, leg and low back pain - and 3 surgeons, (2 orthopedic and one neurosurgeon) are all just dying to get a hold of me. They all say I need surgery - but thanks to your information and stretches and good advice regarding muscle imbalances - I'm not having surgery. I am almost pain free, and some days I am totally pain free. My abilities totally defy my MRI films! Because of you I've made a lot of changes - including the inversion therapy and I want to thank you for keeping me out of surgery. I talk to people every week at the pool who have had surgeries and regret it.</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I don't have to be one of them. With all the doctors, surgeons, specialists, chiropractors, physical therapists I've seen over these many years - you would think they could have told me some of these simple things - but it took you guys - making it understandable and easy to do.</p>
<p>Over the years I've been in casts and braces which only served to make my muscles weak, I've been given wrong advice on exercises to do, I've paid for adjustments which actually made things worse and more. I really want to Thank you for all the down to earth - plain good information.</p>
<p>It's the best I've ever seen. I now understand what is going on with my body and what is causing the pain. The fusion surgery that's recommended to me has an 18 month recovery period, many risks and not much hope really for total relief of the back pain. I sure would much rather spend some time learning from your information, relaxing on an inversion table, doing some simple exercises and stretches and eliminating some of the things I was doing wrong - in order to live my life - free from the hassle, pain, expense, shear dread of having a major surgery.</p>
<p>I don't understand why some people just won't catch on to this - maybe they think a Doctor will just "fix" them and that's the easy answer - but going that route doesn't make sense to me at all - unless it's absolutely necessary and you've exhausted all other options.</p>
<p><strong>Again. Thank You!!!</strong> You guys have even returned my calls when I had quetions - I'm amazed at your level of service and dedication and what you have given me for so little cost. I would have to spend tons of money on surgery and therapy otherwise. I am a real person and I'd be more than happy to tell anyone my story. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/backease.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p>

I mean a VERY SHARP pain!</p>
<p>I waited for about a week and finally went to a chiropractor who sent me for x-rays, then went back 2 days later for the results..  He showed me the x-rays, and said, "This is exactly what I was afraid of. You chipped your spine", and showed me where.</p>
<p>After finding you on the search engine, I ordered your Lose The Back Pain DVD and CDs, and it was a GREAT help, but I still endured some much lesser pain.  Later you e-mailed me about the IT table, and after reading the customer's testimonials, and your 100% guarantee of satisfaction, or your money back, I figured I had nothing to lose, so I ordered it.</p>
<p>Oh man!  U aren’t ever gonna get this back, even if u offer me twice the price. This thing is the next best thing to sliced bread, lemme tell u.  I only hang upside down about 1 minute, and INSTANT results, and no more back pain and stiff neck,that I have suffered with for YEARS.</p>
<p>All I can say is, <strong>THANK U, THANK U, and THANK U some more</strong>.</p>
<p>I have offered to let 3 of my neigbors who have back problems to try it out, for FREE, but they all refused. I just can NOT believe what a dumbded down society we have become. Some ppl still think doctors are their only salvation, while they still suffer their back pain. Oh well...their loss! <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product she used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inversion3.html" title="Read more about Inversion Table">Read more about Inversion Table<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I have 4 issues going on. Without all the fancy terms - I have an "S" curved spine, a slipped vertebrae (class 2) a budging disc - lower back and some stenosis.</p>
<p>I've had a bad time with Sciatica, hip, butt, leg and low back pain - and 3 surgeons, (2 orthopedic and one neurosurgeon) are all just dying to get a hold of me. They all say I need surgery - but thanks to your information and stretches and good advice regarding muscle imbalances - I'm not having surgery. I am almost pain free, and some days I am totally pain free. My abilities totally defy my MRI films! Because of you I've made a lot of changes - including the inversion therapy and I want to thank you for keeping me out of surgery. I talk to people every week at the pool who have had surgeries and regret it.</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I don't have to be one of them. With all the doctors, surgeons, specialists, chiropractors, physical therapists I've seen over these many years - you would think they could have told me some of these simple things - but it took you guys - making it understandable and easy to do.</p>
<p>Over the years I've been in casts and braces which only served to make my muscles weak, I've been given wrong advice on exercises to do, I've paid for adjustments which actually made things worse and more. I really want to Thank you for all the down to earth - plain good information.</p>
<p>It's the best I've ever seen. I now understand what is going on with my body and what is causing the pain. The fusion surgery that's recommended to me has an 18 month recovery period, many risks and not much hope really for total relief of the back pain. I sure would much rather spend some time learning from your information, relaxing on an inversion table, doing some simple exercises and stretches and eliminating some of the things I was doing wrong - in order to live my life - free from the hassle, pain, expense, shear dread of having a major surgery.</p>
<p>I don't understand why some people just won't catch on to this - maybe they think a Doctor will just "fix" them and that's the easy answer - but going that route doesn't make sense to me at all - unless it's absolutely necessary and you've exhausted all other options.</p>
<p><strong>Again. Thank You!!!</strong> You guys have even returned my calls when I had quetions - I'm amazed at your level of service and dedication and what you have given me for so little cost. I would have to spend tons of money on surgery and therapy otherwise. I am a real person and I'd be more than happy to tell anyone my story. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/backease.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p>

I ordered your Lose The Back Pain System for what I would describe as chronic neck pain that I had been trying to manage for years, and also sciatica. After watching the video and carrying out your instructions for almost four weeks now, <strong>I would like to say that you two really are miracle workers</strong>. I had relief for my sciatica after a week and my neck pain has considerably improved. I realize it took a very long time to get my neck in such a painful state, and it will take time for me get it completely right. But I have relief right now and its just getting better every day. <strong>After years and years of pain, it does feel like a miracle to me</strong> - I cannot believe the answer to both my neck and sciatic problems was this simple - just carry out some simple exercises each day and begin the journey to becoming pain free.

However the pain I experienced then was relatively mild and disappeared after a month or two. Two months ago I started to have back pains again, which eventually spread to my right hip, thigh and knee. This time, however, the pain was extreme, lasted 24hrs per day, and I could find no relief. My doctor diagnosed sciatica, recommended physiotherapy and painkillers - all to no avail.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, by this time, I had read your web site and ordered your material. It arrived for me - in Spain - only about 5 days after ordering it. For that, another thanks. I started the exercises for herniated discs and sciatica immediately. After only 2 days, I could honestly say that the cutting edge of the pain had greatly diminished. The last 3 days have seen a rapid improvement. I would estimate that I have made a 98% recovery, like so many of you're other customers, I can simply say, "Thank you so much." It's a gorgeous morning here in Spain, and I have just returned from a pain free walk around the mountain with my dog.

<p>  Thank you for spending so much time with me on the phone the other day. What a great service you provide for those of us struggling with chronic back pain.  I could hear true concern and compassion in your voice.</p>
<p>  As we discussed, chronic pain is one of the most debilitating things a person can encounter in his or her life. It can consume you and disrupts the ability to function at even minimal levels both physically and mentally and even emotionally as time passes.</p>
<p>  I suffer with disc problems that has led to excruciating sciatic pain that at times has left me unable to walk or sit at all. Just laying still was unbearably painful. I have tried many modalities in an effort to "cure" this condition. What I have found is that the most helpful thing I can do is to consistently do the exercises that help with proper body alignment and muscle functioning that you have outlined in your Lose The Back Pain Program.</p>
<p>  I look forward to the addition of the Heal-n-Soothe™ products to further help restore my health. I am sure it will be a great help in my recovery.</p>
<p>  Thank you so much for your dedication to helping those who are in need. You have a great program that will benefit the many people who are truly at the end of their rope and feel they have no where else to turn for help. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/inflammation5.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I have been doing the exercises 2-3 times daily for Forward Tipped Pelvis and the Sciatica stretches for over a month now and I have not gone to the Chiropractor and I am virtually pain free.

And I believe it is largely due to the Lose The Back Pain program of self-assessment and stretches and exercises. Off and on for say 14 years I've had minor (yet occasionally painful) back problems, but nothing that a chiropractor couldn't clear up within a few or more adjustments. Then one day 2 years ago I felt my mid back slip out again doing pull downs and I knew it was the painful kind of slippage.</p>
<p>If I had to pick the 3 most important things I had learned I would have to say (1) do some exercise… (2) do them often… And finally (3) DO THE RIGHT exercises and stretches. After following rules 1 and 2 I had actually built up to swimming laps 20 to 25 minutes 4 times a week, stationary biking, walking up to 2+ miles, yoga, etc. Then I had a relapse, but now I have learned from Losethebackpain that it was due to muscle imbalances (for one, I had ignored my stomach muscles) hence rule number 3. It all makes sense to me now! And this time I'm getting better much faster than last time since I am now focusing more on my muscle imbalances!

<p>Your system has not only improved my pain 150%, but also has helped other areas that were not evident as being problematic. I took the self-assessment and really understood the full aspect of all of my back related issues.

<p>Basically had to sit all the time. Now, I'm happy to say my suicidal sciatica type pain down my leg is completely...I mean COMPLETELY gone. Thanks to you guys and your tips and stretches. Tried everything the way you teach. I can now swim one kilometer straight in a pool.</p>
<p>Normally do about 2 * 500 meters per week though. Taking Himalayan Go Ji juice which I feel made the turning point. Doing your stretches regularly. Did a lot of Trigger Point Therapy throughout the day to nail the hot spots in my buttocks ( Piriformis which was definitely very sore ), and also found hotspots down my calf. Interesting how when "knuckled" it triggered the pain in my feet perfectly. This told me I was finding the right spot. Drinking 1.5 lrs of water a day , several times a week.</p>

I have tried everything to make it go away... chiropractic, physical therapy, acupuncture, etc. with various successes at different times. Last October, I ended up in the emergency room in such agony that I was given morphine to control the pain; I was admitted to the hospital and had an MRI the next day. I was scheduled for emergency surgery and <strong>had laminectomy on L4-L5 and on L5-S1</strong> levels of my spine. I was greatly relieved to have my leg pain gone and was finally pain free! </p>
<p>After approximately six weeks of recovery, I went to the neurosurgeon for my post-operative review and was told to resume exercising to strengthen my back and was given a generic set of exercises to start with. Within three days, my leg pain had returned. I was devastated! Long story short, I started doing my own research and that's how I  found your site. I was interested in the fact that your approach would target the cause of my leg pain and would tailor exercises to help my particular problem. I figured I would try your system instead of the P.T. program I was following without much relief. </p>
<p>I received the video and manual within a few days and started right in; I did the assessments and found that I needed the exercises for pelvis tipped forward, right hip high, and for sciatica. <strong>My leg pain started to improve within a week</strong>; in fact, so much so that I could cut back on the pills within a few days and stopped taking them all together within another week! My improvement steadily continued within the next few weeks. I am now pretty much <strong>pain free for the first time in over five</strong> <strong>years</strong>. I really wish I had found your program five years ago...it may have saved me several thousands of dollars and years of pain! However, at this point I can only be glad to have found it when I did. I hope that others find your program when they initially have back or leg pain. I have never done a testimonial for any other product. Then again, I have never tried a program that made such a difference as yours has for me. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I was pain free in about 4-5 days which was more than a surprise and I haven't had any low back pain in months. Considering the fact that low back pain has been a background feature in my life since a sports injury at age 16 (I'm currently 62)and I've seen chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons, osteopaths and physical therapists plus numerous CT's and MRI's over the decades with no sustained relief it's abrupt departure was startling. Too bad I had to wait 46 years to get relief----and by the way, I'm a physician. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

He sent me to a physio and put me on muscle relaxants, neither of one made any improvement. I searched the Internet for more information and found your web page and liked your approach. When I received your program I also liked the way you have to identify the problem and then treat it. Some of the exercises were the same as the Physio gave me but most were not and I was confident they would all work together to rid me of that terrible agony. In the fall of 2005 I had booked a ski trip to Aspen for the last week of March and was reluctant to cancel it although in January I knew it would be impossible. By the first of February I was feeling some improvement and put the skis on mid February and was absolutely astounded that I could ski without any pain. I was able to go to Aspen and enjoyed a great week of skiing. I still have some numbness in my foot that my doctor tells me is nerve damage but should go away in time. I hope will never experience that pain again, but if I do, I will know exactly where to go for help. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

Pain started shooting down my left buttock and leg to my foot. It subsided after some rest period but never went away. In January of 2006, I had experienced so much pain that getting out of bed was nearly impossible. Chiropractic was not working and massage therapy helped but was not fast enough to relieve the pain. After finding your course on the internet I made a commitment to do the exercises religiously. I started in April and by the end of May I was very happy to see a 90% improvement! Today I'm feeling no more sciatic pain! I am back on the tennis court in full swing and even my "typical" back pain is not there after a couple of hours of playing tennis. Lose the Back Pain course is simple, yet amazingly effective, and I say that from a standpoint of being very skeptical of anything being offered on the internet. I'm glad you had a good position in my search engine to find you fast!

Since March of 2004, I have had symptoms that I can only compare to having been kicked in the behind by a mule. That pain in the butt then took off toward my ankle and made standing or walking a living torture. I started with chiropractic, then orthopedic surgeons, then physical therapists, then massage therapy, more orthopods, anti-inflamatories,and lost all hope for ever recovering.Then an internet search took me to your website, and ever skeptical, I was desperate. Less than a week later, I watched your DVD, read the manual, and determined my course of action (still skeptical, of course); Two weeks later, I THOUGHT I was feeling a little better ( maybe a placebo effect). One Month later, my pain had decreased by 50 %. It is now just over two months into the program, and I can honestly, and amazingly, say that <strong>I am 98% pain free</strong>. I honestly do not believe it, but truth is beauty, as the poet said. Why NO certified practitioner had been able to truly diagnose and isolate the problem, and the CURE, I will never know.

<p>Lose Your Back Pain is a superior product that cuts through the core of suffering so many people have. The exercises and the way you've put them into an easy-to-follow program  work like magic. Your program holds the keys that will not only help eliminate back pain, but may even keep thousands of people out of the doctor's office - other than for brief check-ups. People who have suffered with back pain for years will find relief with your program. I should know because I've seen these exercises work wonders for young and not-so-young. Great work. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

<p>I bought this System for my mother-in-law, Linda. She had painful sciatica for about 6 months and was feeling depressed and helpless. I searched the internet for her and came across your website. After telling her about it she was keen to give it a go. As soon as she received it, she got straight into it and started feeling results very quickly - she is absolutely thrilled and is now pain-free about 95% of the time. This is what she said after about 2 weeks:</p>
<p>'The info has been a most informative and interesting thing. The way it is written and looking and listening to the experts has given me hope and confidence in getting over this. There was such a slow progress for months and now I am seeing and feeling regular improvements.'</p>
<p>My husband and I can't get over Linda's new and excellent posture, she puts us to shame. It's such a relief now as it was unsettling seeing her hunched over, and struggling to walk even with a walking stick. Thank you so much, we are forever grateful for this System!!!</p>

<p>Got the video a couple of weeks ago. At that time I had rather sharp sciatic pain in the left hip and numbness down to the toes of both feet. I did the assessments and found what my primary problem was. I did all the stretches for that condition plus the sciatic stretches several times daily.</p>
<p><strong>For the last several days I haven't noticed and pain at all. This is only two weeks!</strong> About all that is left is the mop up operation. I've still got some tingling in the toes, but no more pain.</p>
<p>This is really a great system and well worth the cost, which was far less than my first visit to a chiropractor who did nothing helpful and, like you said, never offered me my money back if his treatments didn't work.</p>
<p>Thanks again for a great system.

<p>As a user of your program for about four months now, I just wanted to send you some comments. I am 54 years old and have been running for about 28 of those years on the street, concrete, and some soft stuff but not much.</p>
<p>I always enjoyed running because I never had any real pain to speak of all those years, and the workout made me feel good. I probably ran on an average about 20-25 miles per week. Just in the past year or two, I started getting knee, back, joint, heel, hip, sciatic, etc, you name it, I started to get it and each time I would run it was a different adventure.</p>
<p>I realized just in the past 6 months that not only was running causing me to have pain during exercise, but the pain started to be constant and was causing me to be miserable and having serious issues with my work which is Carpentry Construction.</p>
<p>When I got your program and started using it, I could barely move without pain and I diagnosed myself to have a forward tipped pelvis and forward neck roll. Well, let me tell you, most if not all of my constant pain is gone, and yesterday I ran a mile around a local track backwards (like you suggested) and so far I feel fine.</p>
<p>Most people that I tell about your program don't want to listen (even though they are in bitter pain) because they are old fashion in they're thinking and refuse to be open minded to what makes good sense. I believe that most of them are also lazy and think that a pill or just resting will cure their ills. Anyway, thanks for the program, and I will keep you updated on things if you don't mind.

The reason for my need was originally caused by a bad fall, over forty years ago, resulting in a displaced, fractured lumbar vertebra. Over the years, this has given me problems from time to time, but, as I have continued doing sport, the muscles have remained strong enough to compensate.</p>
<p>Now, in my mid-sixties, I have almost ceased competing, while still carrying on coaching athletic throws. As a result, my back really started to give me trouble. As soon as I received your package, I started to do the exercises, and the pain ceased immediately. I carry out an exercise regime every day anyway, but your exercises are now, very definitely, an integral part of it. You have done your bit with the information, now it is up to me to continue using it. The nice part is that I am in control, and, as there are no drugs, there are no side effects.</p>
<p>I have been happily informing youngsters of your existence if they have back pain. I tell them a couple of stretches to do, and it is very pleasant to see the look of amazement as the pain is relieved. Sadly, being young, they probably have yet to visit your site, and, speaking as a coach, I hope that they will never need to, but, at least you have a very strong supporter, spreading the word.</p>

<p>"A few months back I sent for your program. I had fairly severe sciatica (pain level about 9) and also lower back pain. I sent you my profile picture. You helped me with the assessments and found me as having FTP, FHS, LHH.</p>
<p>I have been doing the stretches and exercises. Within a week I could tell that the sciatic pain was considerably less than it was when I started. Now after almost 2 months of faithfully doing the stretches my pain level is down to about a 1 or 2. And that's just in the morning when I get up. I am pain free most days.</p>

<p align="left">Words cannot express how thankful I am for your program. Nearly five years ago I started to develop stinging sharp pains in my legs. Keep in mind, I am in my mid twenties and exercise often, so I am in good shape. I developed the pains from standing all day at work. I thought my leg pain stemmed from bad support in my shoes. So I bought new shoes and decided to go back to a chiropractor. After a few visits to the chiropractor my leg pain began to go away. I thought my problems were solved but I was completely wrong. About six months ago my stinging painful leg pains returned. Again I thought it was from bad shoe support. So I did what I thought would work. I bought new shoes and went to the chiropractor. Unfortunately the pain in my legs began to get worse.</p>
<p align="left">Every step I took, stinging sharp pains would shoot through my legs and lower back. I didn't know what to do and who to turn to. I couldn't run and exercise like I use to because the pain was unbearable. I began to research on-line to see if others were going through what I was going through. My chiropractor explained to me that I was dealing with sciatic pain. So I researched what sciatic pain was all about, and then I discovered the Lose The Back Pain Program. I wasn't sure if my pain was stemming from my back or somewhere in my legs, but I thought I would give the program a try. It was affordable enough, and I really had no other options. I have always been skeptical of any get better fast programs. But to my surprise this program was not like all the others. It wasn't like all the others because it actually worked and I am living proof. I tried the program and realized I did have a sciatic problem, as well as a few other conditions. The program gave me the tools to help correct my conditions and I am so grateful.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>I began to feel relief within days.</strong> That's right, days. I had been in pain for months and I found relief within days! If you are struggling with any type of pain in the neck, back, legs or anywhere else, please give this program a try. Anytime I start to feel stinging in my legs or back, I drop and do the stretches and I am able to feel relief. The best part is that I don't have to take medications and I haven't had to go through any type of surgeries. Thanks Jesse and Steve, you have changed my life!</p>

<p align="left">If you're tired of doctors writing you off and not really caring whether or not you recover from your back pain, then give this system a try. <strong>My lower back was wracked with pain</strong>, I couldn't sit for long periods of time and when I awoke from a nights sleep, instead of being well-rested my aching back was there to remind me of the pain that would be with me throughout the day!</p>
<p align="left"><strong>The doctors couldn't help me or didn't want to take the time.</strong> And so I took matters into my own hands and came across this website. I figured it couldn't hurt and Jesse's and Steve's view that back pain has more to do with muscle imbalances brought on by a lifetime of abuse and neglect than anything else, made sense to me.</p>
<p align="left">Well, I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>four weeks into the program and my back has never felt better</strong>.</span> Even within a week or two I noticed a difference.

Steve spent considerable time with me answering my questions and offering suggestions.</p>
<p>I "get it" because of the considerable research you put into both the enzymes and the muscle imbalance issue. Once I reviewed the books and DVD's, did my assessment and began the stretches, it occurred to me that this is the most common sense approach to healing my body. Why do so many of the professionals not "get it"?</p>
<p>I had convinced myself that taking Celebrex may cause side effects which could endanger my life, but was willing to take the risk for the sake of "quality of life". I am happy to report I no longer take Celebrex, once the only drug that would allow me to function "normally" by blocking the pain. The Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus reduces the inflammation to a point where I can now look forward to a productive day, plan trips and live with about 80% less pain. I am currently working on the other 20% as I gradually, at my own pace, address the muscle imbalances and do the stretches as recommended in the Lose the Back Pain System.</p>
<p>I now apply what I have learnt about muscles imbalances on a daily basis to avoid triggering spasms.</p>
<p>It took me 4 and half years of trial and error before I found your website. Another 2 months of procrastination, scepticism, and reading your articles and newsletters before I finally decided to order the Lose The Back Pain System and the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus. So glad I did, wish I had done it sooner!</p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks Jesse and Steve. I hope you continue to help others as you have helped me.</p>
<p>P.S. Love the new website, great articles in the treatment section.</p>

<p align="left">A big thank you to and everyone connected to Lose the Back Pain. Thank you too to all the kind people who left messages of praise and shared their success stories using your product..... their experiences motivated me and gave me confidence to try your system</p>
<p align="left">After four months of utter hell from backpain caused by a "slipped disc" I did my self assessments and started the exercises. <strong>In the first week I started to feel a difference and after a month I was almost back to normal!</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong></strong>I visited my GP who prescribed very strong pain medication which hardly gave me any relief. I also found that physiotherapy and osteopathy made my condition worse. I consulted an Alexander Technique Therapist and had therapy - this also didn't help. A visit to an orthopedic specialist confirmed my diagnosis of disc lesion. This specialist told me that he could operate but could not guarantee I would find total relief. I felt condemned to a life of misery</p>
<p align="left">I told the surgeon I was waiting for the Lose The Back Pain programme and wanted to try it for a month before I consented to surgery. A week later my package arrived from yourselves......and happily I now can lead a much happier life free from the distressing and crippling back pain from my disc lesion</p>
<p align="left">To anyone considering using Lose The Back Pain self assessment package who is sitting on the fence...don't! This system is worth it's weight in platinum, diamonds and gold.

<p align="left">Received your video and manual 7 days ago and am able to stand long enough at PC to send you a thank you. If only I had known about muscle imbalances earlier ... it would have saved me from the most miserable three months of my life. Not to speak of the $1,000. out of pocket expense for a chiropractor who doesn't acknowledge muscles, period. It's a long story which can be summed up in: I couldn't sit AT ALL, stand for only a minute or so, walk only to get to kitchen, bath, and back to bed. Today, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have absolutely no sciatic nerve pain running down my leg! YIPPEE!</span> </strong>If I'd followed the chiropractor's advice, I'd still be in bed resting between the 3 adjustments a week. So, thank you from the bottom of my heart! (and from the left side of my bottom and hamstring :)</p>

<p align="left">For the past 12 years, I have hardly had a pain free moment with my back.<strong>For the past 8 years I have gone to the Chiropractor every week </strong>and sometimes two and three times, and I was told there my pelvic area shifts out of place. I hurt from my legs to the top of my neck. <strong>It only took a few times doing the back pain exercises and recommendations in the video you sent for me to get relief</strong>, and now I've learned that during the day if I get tight, I can drop and do two specific ones and the pain leaves.</p>

On a scale of 1 - 10 in pain, I hovered between a 7 and an 8, and sometimes even a 9 when I could barely walk. Now, I would say on a very good day I'm a 1, more often a 2, but rarely as much as a 3. I am so grateful, as I had tried osteopathy, occasional pain killers when it was very bad, and massage, which at best only slightly relieved it for a very short time. Usually, I wouldn't notice any relief, and sometimes I felt worse.</p>
<p>By the way, my Personal Trainer is a pretty cynical person who has suffered with a painful back on and off since he had a horrific accident when a young man, and he says the exercises are good, and he does a few of them himself when he's at home doing his own training.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for the emails and pain relief tips you send, I think it is good to know you are out there, and that you gave tips to help specific problems.</p>
<p>The other day I had to go to the doctor's for something else and he said, 'How's the back pain?' He had already put me down to have an epidural, and if that didn't work, then surgery. I was determined that I wouldn't do either. So I told him about the dramatic pain reduction and he said, ' That's marvellous.' I explained about your programme and he didn't even ask the name or anything. It just shows that some doctors still don't believe in self-help or the alternative way to get better.</p>
<p>I hope this letter (which you can use) will encourage others who are only at the beginning stages. The main thing is to have faith in the programme. I really believed it would help me and it did! <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I went to chiropractors, reflexologists, masseuses…I constantly took pain pills, and used Tiger balm, Biofreeze, Bengay, and every other crème that makes you smell old. They simply didn’t work. I have a VERY bothersome sciatica nerve problem mostly down my left leg…but when it really is bad, it throbs down BOTH of my legs. I had this problem since I was 14(I am now 31). It wasn’t until I finally did a Google search for sciatica relief that I found out about your website. It was only a few days before trying to get an appointment with dr. butcher. I finally found the correct stretch for sciatica relief!!!! It didn’t completely go away for good…but whenever I do the stretch, it most definitely helps. I recommend your information to ANYONE...I am so relieved that I didn’t have to get back surgery. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

<p>The stretches are working fine; I am 99% free of any Sciatica in my lower back and also left outside leg. I am also working on a muscle imbalance and an FTP. The muscle imbalance is visually reducing and I am standing a lot straighter, less stoop and more straight legs rather than bent. Of course I am now sitting straight in front of the computer instead of leaning over to the right which I assume caused the muscle imbalance in the first place. I noticed the muscle imbalance 2 to 3 years ago, of course I didn't really know what it was. So that's my story.</p>
<p>Thanks for your System its working excellent for me</p>

<p>Cut the story short I tried to go for acupuncture and acupressure to a Chinese clinic who told me that I had slip disc and that I should rest and lie down on hard mattress or risk never walking again. I had 6 sessions already but no relief. I still have not gone for my next 2 session as these buggers have taken money in advance for 8 sessions.</p>
<p>My doctor also prescribed me stronger anti inflammatory drugs to take which i was not looking forward to.</p>
<p>I was not satisfied with the diagnosis so I decided to surf the net and saw few other product and finally found your site and read the report and I was quite convinced that I will kill the pain before it kills me.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning with severe pain and was feeling a bit panic'd. I was in agony with the pain in my right leg so i took the painkillers to get my focus back and was waiting to hear from your office regarding my access link. Finally I got your email, I was very pleased and I spent the whole afternoon like a good student reading all the materials, listening to all the audios and watching the videos.</p>
<p>After doing all that, I knew what was wrong with me and I tried the stretches as shown on the video and felt the immediate relief and pain was reduced by about 40 percent in the first hour and now after six hours I am almost 80% pain free. I don’t feel the pressure on my hamstring and my pelvis joint anymore although there is some soreness due to the length of time i was in pain which will probably disappear in a day or too.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the outcome and thanks to Steve, Bobby, Jesse  and the rest of the team for their best efforts and continued further development.</p>
<p><strong>Keep up the good work! Cheers...</strong></p>

As a Nurse Manager on a busy orthopedic floor of a community hospital in New York I am often caring for the very people you have set out to help. Men and women of all ages, suffer tremendously with back pain.</p>
<p>In my professional setting they are usually hospitalized secondary to the need for better pain control via intravenous narcotic pain relievers or surgery. Many are ultimately diagnosed with "Failed Back Syndrome", a term not very encouraging to say the least.</p>
<p>In reviewing the Lose the Back Pain materials, I am left with an amazing sense of hope for these patients. Such an easy concept, fix the underlying problem and get permanent relief. I am looking forward to referring my back pain patients to your web site so they may evaluate the concept and hopefully experience the same optimism I had after being introduced to the program.</p>

I mean a VERY SHARP pain!</p>
<p>I waited for about a week and finally went to a chiropractor who sent me for x-rays, then went back 2 days later for the results..  He showed me the x-rays, and said, "This is exactly what I was afraid of. You chipped your spine", and showed me where.</p>
<p>After finding you on the search engine, I ordered your Lose The Back Pain DVD and CDs, and it was a GREAT help, but I still endured some much lesser pain.  Later you e-mailed me about the IT table, and after reading the customer's testimonials, and your 100% guarantee of satisfaction, or your money back, I figured I had nothing to lose, so I ordered it.</p>
<p>Oh man!  U aren’t ever gonna get this back, even if u offer me twice the price. This thing is the next best thing to sliced bread, lemme tell u.  I only hang upside down about 1 minute, and INSTANT results, and no more back pain and stiff neck,that I have suffered with for YEARS.</p>
<p>All I can say is, <strong>THANK U, THANK U, and THANK U some more</strong>.</p>
<p>I have offered to let 3 of my neigbors who have back problems to try it out, for FREE, but they all refused. I just can NOT believe what a dumbded down society we have become. Some ppl still think doctors are their only salvation, while they still suffer their back pain.

I have suffered from severe sciatica for over a year now. I "HAD" been seeing a chiropractor for 11 months. The first 3 months were 4 times a week and then it tapered off to 3, then 2 and at the time I received the video I was going once a week. It angers me to think of all the time I suffered and money I spent and still had the sciatic pain. Out of pure desperation I found the website of lose the back pain. Almost immediately I stopped having the spasms. I do the sciatica stretch everyday, about 2 minutes of my time! I still have a small catch in the joint of my left hip, but I feel in time it will go away. I have not been as faithful on all the other stretches, but I do do them several times a week. I can at least pin point where my problem is in my lower back and why it is hurting. Laziness has stopped my complete recovery! Your video was a God sent. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the public. It scares me to think I was one step away from surgery.

On a Monday at 5pm I purchased online and on the Friday morning it arrived (that's just 3 days all the way from the U.S.A. to Canterbury Kent England). So I performed the self assessments and started on the exercises, including the specific exercises for sciatica. <strong>With in days I was feeling better </strong>and after 2 weeks I am feeling really good. It is now 19 days as I write this and I have just been to see my acupuncturist, and she is amazed at my progress. So my next visit is not for another 6 weeks, and the way things are going I probably won't need to go. I am still asking myself how these exercises can make so much difference??

I went to chiropractors, reflexologists, masseuses... I constantly took pain pills, and used Tiger balm, Biofreeze, Bengay, and every other cream that makes you smell old. They simply didn't work. I have a VERY bothersome sciatica nerve problem mostly down my left leg... but when it really is bad, it throbs down BOTH of my legs. I had this problem since I was 14(I am now 31). It wasn't until I finally did a Google search for sciatica relief that I found out about your website. It was only a few days before trying to get an appointment with dr. butcher. I finally found the correct stretch for sciatica relief!!!! It didn't completely go away for good... but whenever I do the stretch, it most definitely helps. I recommend your information to ANYONE...I am so relieved that I didn't have to get back surgery. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product he used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

The best advice that I received was the exercise procedure in your system. I did these, without fail, every morning before I went out to do my farm chores. If I did not do the exercises, I was sore all day, but when I did, my day was much better. The left groin was the hardest to remedy. About Dec.15th, the pain, in the groin was 95% gone, and I was able to do the hip flexor, without any discomfort!!  I have also had treatments from a muscle &amp; nerve specialist, once a month, for a year. After each treatment, I had no pain for about a week. Now I have to go every 2 months for a treatment. I am once again able to play my winter sport of curling!!</p>
<p>I am grateful to you &amp; lose the back pain crew, for your input and help for my problem. I am sure that without your system, I could not have succeeded in strengthening the proper muscles to ease the pain.

<p>I purchased your Lose the Back Pain System November of 2006 having been suffering from sciatica (with high left hip) for three months. Usual story of osteopathy and painkillers being 'as much use as a Chocolate teapot'!! On reading and watching the information I felt an Immediate lifting of my spirits. I allowed a few days to absorb the details etc then started on the exercise programme. Within three weeks my hips were balanced and I was free of pain - in time to enjoy a trip back to England to spend Christmas with my daughter and family wonderful!</p>
<p>In March of this year I - stupidly - carried some heavy shelving units up the many stairs into my house - 'no problem' I thought. It was a very silly thing to do, of course, and within two days the sciatic, high hip and pain were back. I immediately restarted the exercises and, albeit it took a little longer, the same excellent results were achieved. Needless to say, I have learned my lesson... no more heavy lifting and if I notice my hips are out of balance, I do my stretches.</p>
<p>I am 60, in excellent health, with a healthy lifestyle. Living in Dinan, a medieval town in Brittany, I get plenty of general exercise walking into town and working in my garden which is on three different levels. Last year I landscaped the garden, shifting masses of granite to create rockeries, steps etc. I now look around for a strong man when there is any heavy work to be done!! <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

In 1988 at the age of 39, I severely injured my lower back by lifting a large audio speaker onto my shoulder. Ten minutes later I was practically immobilized, in the worst pain I'd ever experienced. After six weeks of horrible pain I finally went to a chiropractor. X-rays revealed a protruding disc. The chiropractor advised, "Don't show this to an M.D. or you'll be in surgery within a week!"</p>
<p>After six weeks of almost daily visits to the chiropractor, I had about a 30% improvement in flexibility and about 30% reduction of pain. My insurance ran out, so I toughed it out for months, as my condition slowly improved.</p>
<p>A year later I felt pretty good, but suffered from nagging to severe muscular pain in my lower back. This continued uninterrupted until July of 2006, when at age 57, I again lifted improperly and found myself right back in the condition I was in back in 1988. Maybe you know the kind of back pain that you feel all night long, even when you're "asleep."</p>
<p>Later that month, I came across the "Lose the Back Pain" website and ordered the Book and DVD. I studied the materials for a day and then began the proper combination of exercises and stretches. I thought, "This is too easy! How can it do any good?" </p>
<p>Incredibly, within three days I felt significant improvement. After six days I was pain free and flexible, although I sensed that my back was still fragile. Long story short.... I've been pain free for the last 8 weeks. And I mean PAIN FREE for the first time in over 15 years!</p>
<p>I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to try this program. When I started the program I figured I'd be getting my money back. I went from skeptical to amazed. Now I feel a bit guilty that I paid such so little for such a great benefit.</p>

<p>Thank you for writing.  I have been receiving emails from you for approximately one year, but this is the first time I have written back.  I suppose that it is really hard to trust people and "agencies"/doctors/healers these days.  It seems as if everyone is out for a buck.  However, I have been suffering from back pain now for 22 years and I'm simply fed up and am willing to try almost anything...almost!  To be honest, the main reason why I continue to read your emails is because you and your guests have made much more sense to me than all the doctors I have seen put together.  I will definitely get in touch with you once I receive the system and take it for a test drive as I just ordered it yesterday.  Thank you for your support, wisdom, and encouragement, and as I said, I'll be in touch with you soon. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

As soon as I put my foot on the floor after awakening in the morning I would get numbness, electric shock type pain and just so much discomfort it stopped me from doing mostly everything.</p>
<p>I am 63 years old, sounds old but I am a very active person... also very athletic (as far as belonging to a health club... watching small grandchildren..just plain running around all the time... never a dull moment. The pain started about 4-5 months ago..not so bad at first... I thought I was sleeping on one side too long and a nerve was giving me numbness. I would wake up at night and have to change positions to elevate the feeling. It progressively got worse as time went by. It was so bad I couldn't stand it anymore so I made an appointment with my family doctor.</p>
<p>They prescribed Oxycodone at night and some 800 mg pain killer for the daytime I felt like a zombie all the time and didn't want to take pain meds anymore. My family told me to go to see a chiropractor. I didn't... instead I saw your website and thought I would give it a try. Boy am I glad I did!!!</p>
<p>To be honest I listened to the first CD and watched the second video about the exercises zoned in on just my problem (sciatica exercises) four in particular and did them religiously every day at least 3-4 times a day.</p>
<p>I felt better and better the more time that went by and kept doing the exercises. I now only do them maybe once in the morning and once before I go to bed. Sometimes I even skip a night. I HAVE HARDLY ANY PAIN ANYMORE! Thank you for your system it worked for me I am sooooo glad!

<p>Although I work in an office and sit at a computer all day, I have always exercised and have been an avid walker. I consider myself in pretty good shape for 56 years old! However, about a year ago I started noticing a popping, creaking noise in my back when doing yoga, and occasionally would get a shooting pain down my left leg at night. I ignored it for a while, but when it got so bad that I couldn't sleep at night, I started going to a chiropractor. After 9 months of chiro with very little relief, I gave up on that and decided to try physical therapy. They recommended the usual exercises, but when I told them I was already doing all those exercises, they put me in traction. Traction seemed to help the pain somewhat, but a short time after that I started getting pins &amp; needles pain in my left leg.</p>
<p>I also started noticing when I pulled my head down, it hurt in my lower back. This was a new pain since starting the traction! After 12 phys therapy visits, they said there was nothing more they could do for me. On to acupuncture! This did absolutely nothing (surprisingly) and in fact seemed to make the pins &amp; needles worse! I gave up on the acupuncture after 6 visits at $60 each. Needless to say I was becoming very discouraged, and felt like a 90 year old woman sometimes, especially mornings and late evening. So... out of desperation, I started searching the web for info on sciatic pain, and stumbled upon your website. To be perfectly honest, I had to really think about whether I wanted to spend additional $$ on my back problem, since so far nothing had worked; but then, after a really bad day of pain, I decided to just go for it. What did I have to lose?</p>
<p>Well, I am totally and completely amazed at how quickly the exercises worked me. I would say within a few days (maybe 3) I felt 90% better!! I could get in and out of a car without pain, get in and out of bed, etc. I have now been doing your exercises faithfully for about one month, and am just about 100% back to normal. I will continue to do them to keep my back strong.</p>
<p>I am telling everyone about your program! Thank you!</p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product she used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I have been doing the self-assessments and found out I had a forward tipping pelvis. I am doing the recommended exercises twice a day. My sciatica did subside on the 2nd day and I do not longer require painkillers. I can sleep at night and function just about normally during the day.<br />Thank you guys so much for giving me my life back! <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product he used to get lasting relief.</a></p></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

<p>I started with your program right away. I was surprised to see that I had a high hip as I am a avid cyclist and didn't think I would have weak gluts or hamstring muscles. After the first day I felt better and in a couple of days was able to started riding again. I still have some tingling in my left leg but as long as I don't set to long very slight. I will tell you that I am very glad I found your program. I am very pleased with my progress on gaining flexibility the way you have us stretch and are seeing a slight straightening up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thanks for the great program!</em></strong></p>

<p>You are right! I am one of your "Best Customers". Not so much because of what I buy but because of the # of people I refer to your site and because I talk to whoever will listen how amazed I was that your stretches and exercises eliminated the pain of my sciatica nerve from my right buttock all the way down to my ankle. I don't know how any one could stand that pain for two years; I was going insane after two weeks.</p>
<p>I was also amazed by your "money back Guarantee"! I thought that was and still do think that is a very forward thinking and great policy; and thank god and you that the exercises worked and the pain down my leg had left to your therapy.</p>
<p>I have called once or twice since the beginning and your associates have first asked me if I have continued to do my stretches and exercises and the answer has usually been that I have slacked off. I have never had the pain came back down my right leg however my pelvis gets tired and sore. The exercises always help and some of them I can do anywhere. I have even laid down on the Golf Course while waiting to tee off and laid on my back and brought my knees back and forth to my chest. Once I even saw a friend of mine with back pain across from me on another fairway laying down doing the same exercises. I'm sure he called for your CD and work book. He didn't have Sciatica but constant back pain for years and your methods have made his back a whole lot less painful.</p>
<p>So you're right I am one of your better customers Because I am big on telling others about how well "Lose the Back Pain" works. And I sill haven't figured out how that chiropractor knew I would need 23 sessions at $90.00 per session to fix my sciatica pain:)</p>
<p>Fortunately I did not have to take that route as my procedure; your's has and continues to work just fine.</p>

<p>I am extremely thankful to you and Jesse for this program. I have successfully managed my sciatica pain with the help of this program and I am continuing to become normal in my routines.</p>
<p>On Jan 24 2008, I woke up with an unexpected and shooting pain in my right leg, from hip to ankle. I could not stand, it was so unbearable. After lot of difficulties, I could see a physician and he prescribed strong pain killer with anti-inflammatory drugs. It was Thursday so I took 2-day sick leave and started some internet search on the type of pain, its causes and management. By this time I could know it's the sciatica pain.</p>
<p>One of the first websites that caught my attention was www.losethebackpain.com. After seeing so many testimonials, I thought this is the remedy. Still I was suspicious. When I saw Jesse's photograph with his children I had some trust.</p>
<p>I ordered the program and downloaded the same. I was surprised to notice that their toll free assistance works. I followed the instructions, identified my muscle imbalances and started doing the exercises. I found some of the exercises very beneficial hence added more and more exercises most stretching type. This was the mistake. My pain got worse and I called their toll free assistance. I was again pleasantly surprised to hear Steve's voice to help me out. Steve saw my photographs and sent me a sciatica starter guide. I found the program very useful. I would like to write the following salient points about the program and how I managed my situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program works: I had an unstinted trust in the program and in myself. It takes some time to work.</li>
<li>Understand the program and follow the instructions: Initially, my misunderstanding led to the pain getting worse.</li>
<li>Accept the pain as a gift from god: I believe in the principle of karma, hence I accepted the pain as a result of my karma. I did not blame anyone. I stepped back and developed a wonderfully positive attitude, because happiness and grief are part of the life, two sides of the same coin.</li>
<li>Do not hurry: I kept on adding exercises after one or two of them worked for me. This resulted in worsening the pain. Then I stuck to very few exercises for 4-5 days.</li>
<li>Start with the strengthening exercises than the stretching ones: as suggested by Steve, now only (after 5 weeks) I am slowly adding the stretching exercises.</li>
<li>Step back and analyze: Normally I analyzed, what is working for me and what is not. Each person's condition may be different, hence something that worked for me may not work for you. Also, some exercises may not work in the beginning but they may work later. So I tried out different combinations.</li>
<li>Breathing: As suggested by Jesse in the manuals and the audios, I added some breathing exercises; the old holistic method from India known as Pranayam. Soon I realized that the Pranayam not only mends the breathing but also the muscles and the nerves.</li>
<li>Water input: Following another suggestion from Jesse, I increased the water intake and reduced my diet (stopped over eating).</li>
<li>Multivitamins etc.: I started taking multivitamins and more of vegetables and salads.</li>
<li>Activity: I found that lying down in the bed worsens the pain. I went out, to work, for walk and even did spot jogging / treadmill jog. After about 10 days of sick leave I resumed my work, and worked most of the times in the standing position. Activity helped to strengthen my muscles.</li>
<li>Start slow: I found that when I worked too hard on the muscles, the pain got worse. But the results were positive when I started slowly.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">I think it is a great program. I stopped taking medicines after about two weeks. I paid one desparate visit to a chiropractor and two visits to a physiotherepist. That's all. Thanks again Steve and Jesse !!!</p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

<p>I started very gently and slowly with my excercises because I haven't even been able to walk for 2 years. I started to see results almost immediately.

Due to severe pain I haven't been able to do very much of the stretching but I am slowly working on the 4 sciatica moves. I'm looking forward to doing almost all of the stretches in the future. I'm confident that the moves will be an excellent addition to my everyday work-outs. I'm sure they will BE my everyday work-out for the next several weeks while I'm recouperating from my herniatd discs.(2) Thank-you for the positive spin on what could have been a very painfull and and scary future. <a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

Actually, I have been going to therapy requested by my doctor. And, I have let them read your book to help me determine what exercises would be best for my situation. I had x-rays back around the middle of March but just the other day found out what the x-rays showed. Seems I have severe degenerative disease of the L-spine. So, the therapists are recommending not only stretching but also exercise that will help to strengthen my back as well. I do swim Monday thru Friday and have for several years.</p>
<p>This is really a god send as it helps my pain a lot. But, when walking very much my back gets stiff and I tire out very fast. I am 73 and also have CML Leukemia which has been in remission for 2-1/2 years. I was diagnosed in 2005. 7/1/05. And, I also have had a total knee replacement of my right knee. Talk about old age setting in!! This all hit me just after I turned 70. Needless to say, I am working at trying to get back some kind of qauality of life so that I can again walk like I used to - or, at least walk more than I am now. I have read through "Losethebackpain" and feel that the exercises will be a lot of help. When I ordered your book I had sciatic nerve pain on my left side so bad that I had to hold onto the walls to walk and I was afraid I was headed for a wheelchair.</p>
<p>A friend brought me a "Sacro Wedgy" that she had purchased on line. That little tool absolutely solved my sciatic problem almost immediately. But, I still had the stiffness in my back along with pain and I thought your book would address my problems on that score. And, it has to a degree. Hopefully, if I keep up the exercise that has been given by the therapists and incorporate your exercises too, I will get back to the world of the living. Exercise and stretching seem to be the key to arthritis pain. And, of course, swimming and walking and exercising in the water is more than a huge benefit. My husband died 7 years ago but if he were still around, I am sure sex would help alot too?</p>

I was also told the older I get the more my adjustmets may not hold etc- all negative.</p>
<p>I felt there had to be something else I could do instead of treat the symptoms so I went online and found this system! After doing the assesment I felt I had FTP and HH on the right and FHS and sciatica- I could not believe the photos- I thought I was standing straight and my shoulder was down- I was shocked. After doing the excercises for about 1 month (except for sciatica) I realize I stopped having sciatica- I did not have hardly any low back pain when I started but I wanted prevention- not just go along and wait for the next major episode!</p>
<p>I am encouraged and would like some input on a few things. It seems like the sciatica excercizes and the rt HH excercizes contraindicate each other- they are on the same side. Should I not do the sciatica ones? How long until I should take the pictures again and start some regular excercize. Thank you so much for giving all of us hope for a healthy back withoug a lifelong disability.</p>

I've had lower back problems for years. I was a serious weight lifter (3 or more hours a day) for 15 years and injured my shoulder. I've had 4 surgeries and in the process I injured my back and have 4 bulging disks. I'm one of those hard headed people that just won't give up so I continue to lift but am constantly getting injured.</p>
<p>I'm following your program and it started working almost immediately. I can tell from my lifting that due to my shoulder and having to favor it that I definitely have muscle imbalances. After 3 days I didn't feel the soreness in my back that I normally feel. I think this is going to be the program that finally helps me. I've had to hold off for the last week because I was lifting 70 lb bags of rocks with my one good arm and pulled the entire right side of my chest out. As soon as I can move again I'm going to get back to the back workouts and I know it's going to continue to improve.</p>
<p>I get up and do the program for 45 minutes every morning and it makes a huge difference. I'm going to keep you updated on my progress but I do want to thank you because I've been to chiropractors and have seen neurosurgeons and no one has been able to really help me. Thanks so much for this program, it really works!!!!! </p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

The stretches and exercises have helped greatly. I noticed improvement after just 3 days. I need help though. I know I have a right high hip and forward head and shoulders. I could not put fingers or hand under back when lying down so I thought for sure, I had a backward tipped pelvis. But I listed to my body and quit doing those exercises for the BTP because I thought it was causing some pain.</p>
<p>I am confused whether my pelvis is tipped at all. When I look at my photos, it appears fairly normal to me. Can you give me any help on this? For almost 2 weeks now I have been water walking at the pool and I think that is helping a lot also. I also would like to try the inversion table. Do you think I am ready for that yet? In closing, I am so glad I ordered you back pain videos. I am not perfect yet by any means much of the pain has disappeared for now. I would recommend this to anyone with back problems and I am blessed, I come across your site.</p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I have continued them twice daily every day since. I also ordered and started taking the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus as soon as it arrived. In the 4 weeks since I started the stretches, I have achieved about 90% relief from my right hip pain caused by a degenerated disc at L5-S1, as found by an MRI and Xrays last August. </p>
<p>I visited a chiropractor for over 10 months last year for "manipulations" and about 18 sessons of treatment on a DRX-9000. My chiro referred me to have Micro surgery last November that did not decrease my hip pain, and as it got worse, the Ortho doctor my surgeon referred me to told me that I needed more "agressive" surgery than I had received to correct my back problem, and that my hip itself was just fine.</p>
<p>I have not seen any doctors during this 4 weeks, and I have done nothing else to attribute my improvement to except your system and the Heal-n-Soothe™ Plus. I only wish I had found your system 2 years ago when this hip pain first appeared, and I believe that I could have avoided the surgery and all the expenses of seeing chiropractors and ortho doctors completely.</p><a href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the product that was used to get lasting relief.</a></div><a class="ltbp_tms_product_link" href="http://www.losethebackpain.com/getstarted.html" title="Read more about Lose The Back Pain System">Read more about Lose The Back Pain System<span class="ltbp_tms_product_link_arrow"></span></a>                    </div>

I am an acupuncturist, trained at TAI in Columbia, MD. I have treated patients for back conditions with some success, but what I was doing I realized after your program, was reducing the spasms and some of the nagging emotional conflict that was being dynamically stored in their back muscles.</p>
<p>I wasn't allowing them to break free of the syndrome, just giving them time until the next event. Sometimes this was years. So it seemed all right. But it wasn't the patient-empowering experience that I sought. I would send them away with stretching exercises that would help, but not full loosen the overall imbalance. And I didn't realize how easily the imbalances can be corrected once the awareness of what-to and how-to-do are conscious. At least I understood that loosening the tight, and tightening the loose is necessary... I had that part right.</p>
<p>Many thanks to you again.<br />Great program, the type of medicine I believe in with all my heart.</p>

I am a healthy, athletic, 33 yr old, who was diagnosed with a herniated disk nearly 14 months ago. I was in severe, intense, agonizing pain for about 11 months before my pain began to abate. I was told over and over again that surgery was my only choice. But somewhere inside It just didn't seem like the right thing for me. Even though I was in the worst pain of my life I was terrified to undergo what they called a "simple" surgery. Knives near my spinal cord don't strike me as "simple". I just assumed that I would eventually get better.</p>
<p>I don't remember how I started getting these e-mails- but I found them to be tremendously helpful in my recovery process. Like anyone would, I tried everything possible that I thought would help - and went on a journey of healing and self-recovery. Strangely, at each phase of my healing I would be trying a new healing modality and it would miraculously appear in your e-mails, lending credence to each method. I can't say which one was the most helpful, but all of them combined must have done something! I am just glad that you exist. It was very comforting to me to know that there is a community of people out there going through similar ordeals and looking for alternative ways to get better. Thank you.</p>
<p>After months of crippling sciatic and back pain I can walk normally again. I feel like I have been given my life back. In retrospect, I firmly believe that my condition was brought on not just by physical means, but through a crisis of the soul. This e-mail that you sent today about emotions finally spurred me to write and thank you. I did not find any physical improvement until I found spiritual and emotional improvement. I believe that the healing of my spirit led to the healing of my body. And now that I am on the other side I feel so much compassion for all of those people who think that there is just something wrong with their bodies. The doctor's ignore the patient's hearts and spirits to offer then a strictly "physical" treatment.</p>
<p>Thank you for exploring real causes and real treatments for chronic back pain. Sorry this got so long.

It finally caught up with me and I started having debilitating sciatica pain.

Chiropractic and physical therapy helped a little but not enough to get me through the pain. It was so bad I couldn't sleep at night.

After doing your exercises for sciatica, and using the Rub On Relief® and far infrared heating pad religiously, the pain is gone. If it acts up again I just pull out the heating pad and do my exercises.

No more "pain pills" for me!"

I lift weights and do high intensity interval training. My knees have been bothering me for over a year and I also have chronic neck pain due to arthritis. In addition, all of my joints pop and crack regularly. I feel relief in just a short while after applying Rub on Relief. Honestly, I can't believe how good this stuff works. I have very little pain in my knees, my joints pop and crack less, and my neck has less pain and more movement. This is only after using the product for about two weeks. It is eliminating years of discomfort.

Right now, I'm a happy guy." – Mitchell Kornberg

<p>We all know exercise is good for us, but ouch it can hurt. You could ache for days. So here’s a trick to stop pain before it starts… dab a squirt of <strong>Rub On Relief</strong> on right after your workout… before the painful flare-ups. That way you’ll “short-circuit” the pain at the source.</p>
<p>“I use <strong>Rub On Relief</strong> when I’ve had a longer than usual workout, or played basketball. I noticed immediate pain relief from workout soreness.
