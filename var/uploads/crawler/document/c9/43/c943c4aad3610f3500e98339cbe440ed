It is an envelope of  mesh 304 stainless steel that holds wood chips or pellets. The airspaces in the mesh are small enough that they limit the amount of oxygen that gets in so the wood smokes and never bursts into flame.  Put it on top of the cooking grate, on the burners, on the coals, or  stand it on edge  at the back of your grill.   It holds enough wood for about 15 minutes for short cooks, so you need to refill it or buy a second pouch for long cooks like pork shoulder and brisket. Mine has survived more than 50 cooks.  <a href="http://amazingribs.com/BBQ_buyers_guide/barbecue_accessories.html#mos">Click  for more info</a>. </p>

			              <h4>BIG NEWS!</h4>
<h4>Rupari Foods And AmazingRibs.com Join Forces</h4>
<h2 align="center">Two barbecue leaders join forces to bring the art and science of barbecue, grilling and outdoor cooking to consumers throughout the country</h2>
<p>February 10, 2015 – Rupari Foods, one of the world's largest producers of pre-cooked &quot;heat and eat&quot; ribs, pulled pork and other barbecue meats for grocery stores, has purchased AmazingRibs.com, the world's largest and most popular barbecue and grilling education website.</p>
<p>Based in Brookfield, IL, near Chicago, AmazingRibs.com is by far the largest and most popular barbecue and grilling website in the world with almost 1.5 million visitor per month. The site is rich with recipes, tips on technique, mythbusting science, and product reviews.</p>
<p> Based in South Holland, IL, also near Chicago, Rupari is famous for producing Tony Roma's slow cooked and naturally smoked ribs and pulled pork barbecue, available throughout the country in groceries.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only do we love the convenience of ready-to-eat barbecue, we love cooking from scratch," said Jack Kelly, CEO of Rupari. &quot;The barbecue market is in for explosive growth,  and this positions us to better meet the needs of the consumer by keeping our finger on the pulse of barbecue lovers and adds a talented cook to our product development team.&quot;</p>
<p>Meathead Goldwyn, founder of AmazingRibs.com,  will join Rupari as President of the new AmazingRibs.com division. &quot;Nothing on AmazingRibs.com will change other than we now have a savvy partner with visibility in hundreds of stores. This will help us reach more people,&quot; he said. &quot;And we now have financial muscle behind us if we need it. But best of all, I won't have to do payroll and file tax returns! That alone will save me many hours that I can devote to recipe development! Also, our employees now all get 401K plans and comprehensive health care. We are thrilled!&quot;</p>
<p>Most important for the many loyal fans of AmazingRibs.com, this insures the survival of the website should Meathead die. &quot;I was sole proprietor and I am 65. My wife had no interest in running the business. Now we have a succession mechanism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is our gift to barbecue lovers and grilling enthusiasts everywhere,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;There will always be an AmazingRibs.com.&quot;</p>
<p>Meathead adds &quot;Nobody need worry. I am in good health and I plan to work many more years. I love what I am doing! I come down the stairs of my home in my sweat pants and my commute is over. In addition to cooking, writing, and taking pictures for a living, I now have the opportunity to work with Rupari to create new and improved barbecue for grocery stores and restaurants. Think about the potential: Only 40% of the nation's grocery stores carry ready to eat barbecue. That means a lot of room for growth. This is a great challenge for me.&quot;</p>

                            <p class="bodytext">Barbecue <a href="BBQ_articles/barbecue_history.html">was probably discovered</a> by some proto-human tribe padding warily through the warm ashes of a forest fire following their noses to a particularly seductive scent. When they stumbled upon the charred carcass of a wild boar they squatted and poked their hands into its side. They sniffed their fragrant fingers, then licked the greasy digits. The magical blend of warm protein, molten fat, and unctuous collagen in roasted meat is a narcotic elixir and it addicted them on first bite. They became focused, obsessed with tugging and scraping the bones clean, moaning, and shaking their heads. The sensuous aromas made their nostrils smile and the fulsome flavors caused their mouths to weep. Before long mortals were making sacrifices and burnt offerings to their gods, certain the immortals would like to try their heavenly recipes.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">Anthropologists even think that it was mastery of fire that permanently altered our evolutionary path and it is this primeval link that makes us still love cooking over flame so.</p>
                            <h2>Kissed by smoke, hugged by sauce, licked by fire</h2>
                            <p class="bodytext">Today we do it the same way our ancestors did. Our noses lead us to meat roasted by live fire and we eat without forks or linen. Just pig on a stick, grease and goop on our faces. The meat is ethereal, kissed by smoke, hugged by sauce, and licked by fire. &quot;Don't play with your food&quot; doesn't apply when you're eating barbecue. If you don't get it on your shirt you're not doing it right. This is primal, elemental, sensual eating. Pure carnal joy. Just like our ancestors.                            </p>
<p class="bodytext">So this website is not so much about cooking as it is about the happiness derived from creativity, by self-expression, and the selfless act of feeding others. But just because our ancestors learned to cook outdoors doesn't mean that it comes as second nature to us all. That's the reason for this website, to pass along the ancient art as it has always been taught, generation to generation. To pass the flame from an old timer like me to a young'n like you.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext"><img src="images/pix/lick.gif" alt="Great BBQ sauce" name="Great_BBQ_sauce" width="170" height="197" class="fltrght" id="Great_BBQ_sauce" />There are a lot of <a href="recipes/index.html">step-by-step recipes</a> from the canon of dishes a barbecue cook needs to know, but the meat and potatoes of AmazingRibs.com are the <a href="tips_and_technique/index.html">concepts and techniques</a> that allow us to feed friends and family well. And then have them worship us.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">But we are not <em>homo erectus</em> huddled around a campfire. We are a technologically advanced society and we have learned that a lot of the old ways are old husbands' tales, more myth than fact. Today our knowledge has taught us ways to do thing better than ever before, and there is a strong scientific bent to this website. We want you to understand the theory and not just follow a recipe. We are a blend of poetry and chemistry. One of our mottos is &quot;Give a man a fish and he will probably get it stuck to the grill. Teach a man to cook a fish and he will be a hero.&quot;</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">Making it happen is not that hard. Just about anything you can cook in the kitchen can be cooked outdoors if you know a few tricks. And this site will teach you the tricks of controlling temperature and time, essential for cooking anything.                            </p>

				            <h2>If you boil ribs the terrorists win</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">The backyard kitchen is built on myths. AmazingRibs.com specializes in mythbusting and teaching the fundamental facts you need to know to be a great outdoor cook.</p>
				            <h2>Myth #1: Boil ribs to make them tender</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">A lot of folks boil their ribs. Don't do it! You wouldn't boil a steak would you? When you boil meat and bones, you make flavorful soup. That's because water is a solvent that pulls much of the flavor out of the meat and bones and makes the meat mushy. Boiling also removes vitamins and minerals. That's why the water is cloudy when you're done. That's flavor in the water. DOH! Taste tests have shown that ribs are most flavorful when <a href="tips_and_technique/thermodynamics_of_cooking.html#roasting">roasted</a>. If you are in a hurry, you are better off steaming or microwaving ribs and then finishing them on the grill or under the broiler. Just don't boil 'em if you want max flavor! If you boil ribs the terrorists win.</p>
				            <h2>Myth #2: The best ribs fall off the bone</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">Barbecue judges agree: Properly roasted ribs are tender but still have some chew, similar to a tender steak. They don't fall off the bone. If they do, chances are they have been boiled. Click here to learn <a href="tips_and_technique/amazing_ribs_defined.html">what the experts think Amazing Ribs taste like</a>.</p>
				            <h2>Myth #3: Thermometers are for sissies</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">I don't care what the TV chef said, you cannot tell anything about the temp of a grill is by holding your hand over the grate and counting &quot;1001, 10002, 1003&quot; until your palm bursts into flame. Each of us reacts differently to heat, and the heat 1&quot; above the grate can be significantly different than 6&quot; above. Maybe an old pro who cooks 100 steaks a night can do this parlor trick, but you cannot.</p>
				            <p class="bodytext">Likewise, you may have also heard that you can tell the doneness of a steak by poking it and comparing the bounciness of the meat to the tip of your nose or the flesh between your thumb and forefinger. As if everyone's hand has the same firmness and bounciness! As if a filet mignon has the same firmness and bounciness of a sirloin! Lookit, almost all professional chefs carry a meat thermometer in their chef's coat. There's a reason.</p>
				            <p class="bodytext">Finally, you cannot rely on popup thermometers in turkeys, and most dial thermometers built into grills are waaaaay off, often 50&deg;F, and the temp in the dome is different than the temp on the cooking surface.</p>
				            <p class="bodytext"><a href="http://amazingribs.com/bbq_equipment_reviews_ratings/thermometer-reviews-and-ratings">The single most important thing you can do to improve your cooking is get a good digital thermometer for your grill and another for food.</a></p>
				            <h2>Myth # 4: Soak wood before using it</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">When I soaked wood chunks overnight, they gained about 3% by weight. Chips gained about 6%. I cut the chunks in half and penetration was only about 1/16&quot;. DOH! That must be why they make boats out of wood! Wood doesn't absorb much water! If you toss wet wood on a hot grill, the small amount of water just below the surface will evaporate rapidly, negating any effect of soaking. On charcoal, the wet wood cools off the coals when it is important to hold the coals at a steady temp. Learn more about the <a href="tips_and_technique/zen_of_wood.html">Science of Wood</a>.</p>
				            <h2>Myth #5: The juices from a steak are blood</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">If they were blood they would be dark, almost black, like your blood. And they would be thick and coagulate. No, the blood is drained during slaughter. The juices on your plate are a protein  rich liquid called <em>myoglobin</em>, so stop grossing out your kids by calling it blood. Click here to read more about <a href="tips_and_technique/thermodynamics_of_cooking.html#maillard">meat science.</a></p>
				            <h2>Myth #6: Always use tongs, never forks</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">Don't worry about poking holes in the meat. A steak is 70% liquid (much of that myoglobin), so if you poke a hole in a 16 ounce steak and it loses 1/4 ounce of juice, you'll still have more than 9 ounces of fluid left. When you cook, however, you can lose up to 20% from evaporation and dripping. That's more than 3 ounces.

				            <h2>Myths #7, 8, 9, and beyond:</h2>
				            <p class="bodytext">Here are some more myths explored on these pages or coming soon: Searing seals in juices. Pink pork is undercooked. If there is red in chicken it is undercooked. If you're lookin' you ain't cookin'. Cooking time depends on the weight of the meat. The bone adds flavor. Oil the grates before putting food on them. Flip burgers only once. The Stall is collagen melting. High heat is the best heat. Whole chicken tastes better than chicken cut into parts. Beer can chicken is the best chicken. Melting fat penetrates the meat. Grilling causes cancer. Grill marks are important. Medium and medium rare are the same thing. Stainless steel grills are better. Cast iron grates are the best. </p>
				            <p class="bodytext">Many more within. You can rely on your grill's built in thermometer. Ground beef is the riskiest food for pathogens. Barbecue sauce is always red. Marinades add a lot of moisture to meat. Start with the <a href="table_of_contents.html">Table of Contents</a>.</p></td>

                            <p class="bodytext">Steaks are easy. Hard to mess up. Regardless of what cut you cook, there are some basic tips and techniques that can raise your game, and when you master them, you will have your guests reeling in deliria.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">In this all new article, in my typically exhaustive style, we focus on the best cuts, the best grades, thickness, prep, cooking method, testing for doneness, serving, accompaniments, and much more.

                            </h2>
                            <p class="bodytext">Ribeyes. Just typing the word makes my keyboard cower in fear of drool. Ribeyes are, in my humble opinion, the best steaks on the steer. And Chef Jamie Purviance agrees. Jamie is the well known author of several cookbooks, most recently the New York Times bestseller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0376020598?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amazingribs--20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0376020598" target="_blank">Weber's Way to Grill: The Step-by-Step Guide to Expert Grilling</a>.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">Jamie and I got together last month with two identical Weber Kettle charcoal grills to answer the kind of question that keeps steak lovers like us up all night: When is the best time to sear a steak, when you start cooking, or at the end of the cook? Believe it or not, when you sear the steak makes a huge difference in flavor, texture, and juiciness.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">Dueling grills, dueling ribeyes cut from the same roast side-by-side. May the best steak win. Completely unrehearsed, <a href="tips_and_technique/cooking_temperatures_and_reverse_sear.html">watch the video  and see what happened</a>.</p>

                            <p class="bodytext">It includes the latest USDA recommendations as well as chef recommendations (and they often differ) as well as color photos of the different stages of doneness for red meats. Designed for grillers' quick reference, the temperatures are the same for both indoor and outdoor cooks.</p>
                            <p class="bodytext">Most cookbooks contain outdated meat temperature info since the USDA has  changed its recommendations several times. Knowing the best temps is essential to cooking safe and great food. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/dsFoodborneEstimates/" target="_blank">The Center for Disease Control</a> estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans gets sick from foodborne illnesses, (often mistakenly called &quot;stomach flu,&quot;), and 3,000 die.

                            <p class="bodytext">Cooking without a thermometer is like driving without a speedometer. A good temperature guide like this and <a href="http://amazingribs.com/bbq_equipment_reviews_ratings/thermometer-reviews-and-ratings">a good digital thermometer</a> are essential for every cook, especially backyard cooks.</p>
