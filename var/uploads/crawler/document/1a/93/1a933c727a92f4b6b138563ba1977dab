			<h1>DownToad = Free Software!</h1><br/><br/>

			<p class="tagline">The internet is inundated with free software. The reviewers at DownToad are always on the lookout for the good stuff!</p>

			<p>DownToad is your spot on the net to find great new software applications for your Windows computer. We specialize in personal computers, so if you are looking for mobile device software applications you are in the wrong part of the pond. Perhaps one day we will expand into the mobile realm, but for now the Toad is only working hard to make your PC a better place to be.</p>

<p>DownToad does not make the free software you find on our site. We do however scour the internet for software being given away for free by the original software manufacturers, review what they are putting out there, and consider offering it to you here on our site as well.  Always free of course.  So right up front, you can always download the software from DownToad, or you can click on the link in the specific software review page to the original manufacturer and download the file from them.</p>

<p>If you do choose to download the files from DownToad after reading or reviews, note that we do use a modified installer that is different from the ones used by the various software manufacturers.  The Download Manager will more than likely offer you additional and optional software installations during the time you are installing the reviewed software. You can easily decline this offered software by clicking the Skip All button during the installation if you do not want to see the offers.</p>

<p>If you do accept the offers, and later on you wish to uninstall any software downloaded from DownToad or recommended by the Download Manager, you can easily uninstall anything by following the usual uninstall instructions.  We have created a page on DownToad to help assist you in this manner as well, the aptly named Uninstall page.</p>

<p>Also of note, DownToad does receive funding from the Download Manager and that is how we are able to step away from our day jobs to review software and present it to you on DownToad.  No software on DownToad will ever require payment, and you should never pay DownToad ever for anything.</p>

			<p><strong>Additional & Optional Advertising Offers</strong></p>

			<p>The Download Manager might recommend you to install the InternetHelper Toolbar (powered by Conduit/Bing). You can decline to install it.</p>
<img src="http://www.downtoad.com/images/toolbar.jpg">
<p>InternetHelper is a free toolbar add-on for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome that gives you easy access to local weather, social alerts, news, and more. DownToad distributes free software, we can do this because we generate revenue by offering, on an opt-in basis, our users additional software offers from our advertising partners during the installation process, via the Download Manager. If you do not want to use our install to download and install software, you are more than welcome to download the unmodified installation file from the specific manufacturer's website.</p>

<p><strong>Modified Installer:</strong></p>

<p>DownToad is distributing custom installers which are different from the originally available distribution. These new installers comply with the original software manufacturers' policies and terms & conditions, however, they are not the originals.
The Download Manager manages the installation of your chosen software. In addition to managing your download and installation, the Download Manager will offer free popular software that you may be interested in. You are not required to install any additional software to complete your installation of your selected software. You can always completely remove the programs at any time in Windows' Add/Remove Programs.</p>
