				At WorldPantry.com, we connect lovers of great food with the people who make it.
				We are dedicated to becoming your favorite source for the best, most delicious foods
				available anywhere and to providing you with exceptional service throughout your online
				shopping experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				As food lovers ourselves, we know that great food is about wonderful ingredients,
				special recipes, and production methods that have been perfected over time. But
				even more than that, we believe great food comes from talented people and teams who
				put their hearts into providing the very best products available - by using only the
				highest-quality ingredients, by infusing their foods with passion and creativity, and
				by refining their products to delicious perfection.
			</p>
			<p>
				We seek out the best producers who make exceptional products, and then we partner with
				them to share their products with the world. Our partners are food companies who have
				created very loyal customer followings and won kudos within their industries including:
				<a href="http://shop.numitea.com/" target="_blank">Numi Tea</a>,
				<a href="http://shop.scharffenberger.com/" target="_blank">SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate</a>,
				<a href="http://shop.traditionalmedicinals.com/" target="_blank">Traditional Medicinals</a>,
				<a href="http://www.lotusfoods.com/" target="_blank">Lotus Foods</a>,
				<a href="http://shop.oregonchai.com/" target="_blank">Oregon Chai</a>, and
				many, many others. Some of our partners are large companies and some are small artisanal brands,
				but they all have great products and great people.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each of our partner food companies, we manage their complete direct-to-consumer ecommerce
				operation including: creating and managing their ecommerce webstore, handling customer service
				phone and email inquiries, and provide fast shipping and delivery. When you order from any of
				these partner websites, you know that WorldPantry stands behind every product and the complete
				shopping experience. Every order is backed by the WorldPantry 100% Satisfaction Guarantee –
				"If you are not absolutely satisfied with your purchase, for any reason, let us know. We will
