            <p>To make sure TRUVADA for a PrEP indication is prescribed and taken safely, Gilead has worked with the FDA to develop materials for the REMS program to educate and inform healthcare providers and uninfected individuals at high risk for acquiring HIV-1.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>By inhibiting HIV-1 from replicating as it enters the body, TRUVADA for a PrEP indication works to prevent the virus from establishing permanent infection. However, TRUVADA should not be seen as the first line of defense against HIV-1 infection</li>
                            <li>Because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 infection, TRUVADA for a PrEP indication must be used in combination with a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes safer sex practices, such as regular and correct condom use, regular HIV testing for themselves (and their sexual partners), and other proven HIV prevention methods to safely and effectively reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection
                                <ul>
                                    <li>TRUVADA for a PrEP indication must only be prescribed to uninfected individuals at high risk who are confirmed to be HIV-1 negative</li>
                                    <li>Uninfected individuals who are prescribed TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not miss any doses. Missing doses may increase the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>In one clinical trial of TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, TRUVADA was shown to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition by 42% for high risk men who have sex with men who also received comprehensive prevention services, including monthly HIV-1 testing, condom provision, counseling, and management of other sexually transmitted infections</li>
                            <li>In a post-hoc case control study of plasma and intracellular drug levels in about 10% of clinical trial subjects, risk reduction appeared to be the greatest in subjects with detectable intracellular tenofovir. Efficacy was therefore strongly correlated with adherence</li>
                            <li>Because of the intensive risk reduction counseling provided as part of the trial, self-reported risk behavior among the subjects in this clinical trial declined overall during the trial, both in terms of decreases in the number of sexual partners and increases in condom use</li>
