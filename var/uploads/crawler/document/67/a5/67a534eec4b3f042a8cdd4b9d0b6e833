<p>Former 'SNL' Actress Victoria Jackson on Political Bias at Anniversary Show: "Is Lorne Ashamed of Me?"

by Paul Bond, 2/18/2015 4:22pm PST

Victoria Jackson, a six-year veteran of Saturday Night Live, is publicly wondering if her opposition to gay marriage prompted Lorne Michaels to treat her differently than the other cast members who attended the 40th anniversary of the show Sunday.

Jackson, on her Facebook page, Twitter and in interviews, has mostly raved about Michaels and thanked the creator of SNL numerous times for hiring her in 1986, though she is also saying that she was the only castmember at Sunday's event to be banished to an overflow room.

Some bloggers noted the oddity and were wondering if Michaels or someone else involved with the seating arrangements might have been sending a political message to Jackson, who is a Christian conservative, a Tea Party favorite and an extremely vocal critic of President Barack Obama.

While Jackson herself has been downplaying politics, she did speculate on a radio show Tuesday that her views about homosexuality might have played a role.

"I was the only castmember put in the overflow room," Jackson told radio host Rusty Humphries. She said cast SNL alum Robert Smigel also noted that she was the only castmember in the lesser room.

A source close to the show told The Hollywood Reporter that there was no political bias involved at all. In fact, Jackson was offered a seat in the main studio, but when she alerted NBC that she might arrive late, her seat was moved to a nearby viewing space so that she would not interrupt the live show.

But Jackson said on the radio show that she arrived around the same time as Al Sharpton and actor Alan Cumming, and she even recalled complimenting Cumming, a gay man, on his book.

"He didn't know whether to be nice to me or not," she said. "I think the gay community is really mad at me for saying Glee shouldn't have homosexual themes in primetime for children."

Later in the interview she noted that there were "token" conservatives in the audience, including Sarah Palin and Donald Trump, and she further speculated about her exclusion from the main room: "The only thing I can think of is the gay thing, because it's such a strong movement. Maybe Lorne was like, 'Where do we sit Victoria?'"

Much of the spreading rumor of political bias, though, is being fueled by an Inside Edition interview of Jackson, though the gymnast-comedienne said that the interview was edited in such a way as to make it look like she was accusing SNL of mistreating her because she is a conservative.

Inside Edition "twisted my story a bit," Jackson wrote at her website. "Inside Edition also left out the part where I said that several people in the celebrity crowd whispered to me that they share my political views."

She also wrote: "So, it's still a mystery. Did Lorne Michaels' beautiful 20-year-old assistant make a mistake and hand me the wrong bracelet? Was I blacklisted for disagreeing with the president/media's ideology? Was it because I am a Christian? Is it because I believe in the Biblical definition of marriage and publicly spoke out against homosexual themes in primetime TV shows? Is Lorne ashamed of me?"

Her lengthy post included video of her very first skit on SNL, which is embedded below, as is audio of the radio interview.</p>

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14990100">Don't you love it when an attractive girl has no power over you?</a></strong>
<p>I was at a work related conference last week.  There was this one young lady, smoking hot, had guys vying for her attention the entire event.

Anyway, we rode in the shuttle from the hotel to the airport together.  I purposely chose the row  behind her rather than sitting next to her because it was quite early and I was tired.  I can tell she didn't like that.

Anyway, we made some small talk while we were checking our luggage.  She made a comment about how we had time to kill before our respective flights and should hang out.  I almost agreed until she mentioned she didn't know where she put her wallet and maybe I could buy us some lunch?  She kind of did a cute laugh with it but I can tell she was serious.

I politely declined and told her I was going to take a nap before my flight, it was nice to meet her.  She was stunned, I could tell she wasn't used to guys not bending over for her. (I'm the type of guy I've realized no one ever suspects I'm gay)

I honestly don't blame her, as I know if she was an attractive guy I would have said yes in a heart beat.  Still, I felt it was a nice lesson, was glad my gayness could help bring her down to earth a bit.</p>

<p>Shades of Snowpiercer.

I know global warming gets all the attention, but global cooling would be far worse. 

We are living in an interglacial era. Every time the world gets closer to our current peak, it quickly plunges into another ice age. These interglacial periods appear to have some correlation with sunspot activity. The latest news on sunspot activity is similar to other cold spells. 

Although sunspot data only goes back a few hundred years, the "mini-ice age" from 1250-1850 leads to this detail-

[quote]…if history is a guide, it is safe to say that weak solar activity for a prolonged period of time can have a negative impact on global temperatures in the troposphere which is the bottom-most layer of Earth’s atmosphere - and where we all live. There have been two notable historical periods with decades-long episodes of low solar activity. The first period is known as the “Maunder Minimum”, named after the solar astronomer Edward Maunder, and it lasted from around 1645 to 1715. The second one is referred to as the “Dalton Minimum”, named for the English meteorologist John Dalton, and it lasted from about 1790 to 1830. Both of these historical periods coincided with below-normal global temperatures in an era now referred to by many as the “Little Ice Age”. In addition, research studies in just the past couple of decades have found a complicated relationship between solar activity, cosmic rays, and clouds on Earth. This research suggests that in times of low solar activity where solar winds are typically weak; more cosmic rays reach the Earth’s atmosphere which, in turn, has been found to lead to an increase in certain types of clouds that can act to cool the Earth.

Here is the link that got me thinking. Notice how the planet is at the peak temperature. Hundreds of thousands of years of data, all showing that we are on the cusp of a new ice age.</p>

<p>BLIND GOSSIP 11/17 **#2**

We told you that the photos of this kissing couple were misleading. Now we’re ready to spill the details! This couple is FAKE. The reason it is fake is because the male half of this pair is a friend of Dorothy’s. That’s right. He is gay!

A little background for you: He has known that he is gay for many years now, but he has not had a serious boyfriend yet. Both of his parents are celebrities in their own right. He came out to his mother first. She is a fairly open-minded person and was cool about it. Then he came out to his father… and the father was NOT cool with it! In fact, he was pretty much of a macho jerk about the whole thing. 

The whole experience of having his father reject him was crushing for the boy and the two practically stopped speaking after that. Do you remember when the son started using his mother’s last name? Many speculated that it was because he was mad at his father for cheating on his mother. No. While he was upset about his father’s infidelity the main reason he started using his mother’s name is because his father rejected him for being gay. So that bring us to today. His parents, sibling/s, and close friends know that he is gay but they are not pushing him to come out. He desperately wants his father to fully accept him for who he is. Father and son are speaking again but it is still a little tense between them. 

The father is making strides in accepting his son’s sexual preference but is not totally there yet. And what’s the girl doing there? She’s just using the boy for the publicity. No big surprise there.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14985802">Do You Have a First Edition of The Iliad?</a></strong>
<p>J-Lo's character in The Boy Next Door does, and so people decided to see if they could find another copy.  I wonder how many people read that script and said, hold on...?

"A scene in Jennifer Lopez’s new film in which her character is given a supposed first edition of The Iliad has prompted viewers to attempt to find their own first edition of an epic poem composed at least 2,000 years before the invention of the printing press.

According to books marketplace AbeBooks, since Lopez’s film The Boy Next Door was released in the US on 23 January, “The Iliad, first edition” has been its top search term, ahead of To Kill A Mockingbird. AbeBooks attributes this to a scene in the film in which Lopez’s character, a high-school teacher, is given a hardback copy of the book by the teenager with whom she is to go on to have a dangerous affair.

“Oh my God – this is a first edition? I can’t accept this, it must have cost a fortune,” she tells her admirer. “It was a buck at a garage sale – one man’s trash...” he replies.

“It appears people who have watched the film are trying to identify the actual edition handed to Lopez, which has dark yellow and blue boards. I cannot match the book seen in the movie to anything currently for sale on AbeBooks. It could be a movie prop and not even be a real book. It certainly appears to be an attractive book,” said AbeBooks spokesman Richard Davies.

Sadly for the film’s fans, The Iliad, the 15,000-line poem about the Trojan war attributed to Homer, was composed around 700BC, long before the invention of the printing press in 1440. The oldest complete text is from the end of the 10th century, the Venetus A manuscript, with the work not widely disseminated in English until George Chapman’s 17th-century translation, immortalised by John Keats’s poem."</p>

<p>I was 12 or 13 when I found my dad's "Everything you wanted to know about sex" book in the basement.  It read it cover to cover and finally learned the basics of sex.

I recall reading the section about masturbation and wondering what that was. I rubbed my cock just as it described and suddenly thick cum came out.  I thought I had peed but it smelled more pungent and was sticky.  (I have never had a wet dream).  After that I'd do it every day.  First with two hands, rubbing back and forth like I was churning butter.  After a while I learned to do it with one hand.

Many complain that that book had misleading and incorrect info about homosexuality but I didn't realize it at the time.</p>

<p>An American company is conducting research which would allow men who are unhappy with the results of the procedure to reverse their circumcision

18 Feb 2015

Foregen, a not for profit group which was founded to “research and implement regenerative medical therapies for circumcised males”, recently announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund further studies of foreskin regrowth.

“In the short term, we hope to fully regenerate human foreskins,” reads a statement on Foregen's website, a goal it claims will require $3m worth of funding over three years. “Once we have accomplished that, our goal is to advance onto human clinical trials as soon as it is safe to do so.”

They say this regeneration can be achieved by creating an extra-cellular matrix for tissue, which provides attachment points for cells. If stem cells are added to an appropriate ‘skeleton’, they will grow into a functioning, sensitive foreskin.

Foregen have already experimented on animals and have made steps towards recreating bull foreskins. Other scientists have been able to partially regenerate human breast and vaginal tissue.</p>

<p>I just recently moved here, and while I don't work in Hollywood, one of the things I've noticed that is so many people still seem to think that LA will be the solution to their career. They think all they have to do is know the right people and do the right projects and BAM!, they'll become successful. 

While I'm sure that's part of the process, it seems that too many people in LA are the SAME. They don't stand out--not in looks and not in the work they're producing. And when you're competing with 10394203948039 other people, wouldn't it do a person well to at least stand out from the pack? 

It also seems that people are too dependent on the Powers That Be in Hollywood. Unless you're trying to be an actor, I don't see why you would wait around for someone ELSE to pick you for a project. I don't know--write your own script, shoot your own movie, write a song. Do SOMETHING proactive. Because even as an outsider, I have a feeling that Hollywood/the entertainment business doesn't really give a damn about anyone until they make a name for themselves. The days of promoting random people as "stars" or working your way up the directing/screenwriting ladder seem over. You have to do it yourself first.

<p>The only word I can use to describe this is cruel, despicably cruel:
Madison – Gov. Scott Walker believes a new law that gives gay couples hospital visitation rights violates the state constitution and has asked a judge to allow the state to stop defending it.

Democrats who controlled the Legislature in 2009 changed the law so that same-sex couples could sign up for domestic partnership registries with county clerks to secure some – but not all – of the rights afforded married couples.

Wisconsin Family Action sued last year in Dane County circuit court, arguing that the registries violated a 2006 amendment to the state constitution that bans gay marriage and any arrangement that is substantially similar.

Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen refused to defend the lawsuit, saying he agreed the new law violated the state constitution. Then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, hired Madison attorney Lester Pines to defend the state.

Walker, a Republican, replaced Doyle in January and fired Pines in March. On Friday, Walker filed a motion to stop defending the case.

“Governor Walker, in deference to the legal opinion of the attorney general that the domestic partner registry…is unconstitutional, does not believe the public interest requires a continued defense of this law,” says the brief, filed by Walker’s chief counsel, Brian Hagedorn.

Hagedorn told Dane County Circuit Judge Daniel Moeser that if he could not withdraw from the case, he would like to amend earlier filings to reflect Walker’s belief that the registries conflict with the state constitution.

Even if Walker is allowed to withdraw from the case, the law would still be defended in court because gay rights group Fair Wisconsin intervened in the case last year.

Fair Wisconsin attorney Christopher Clark said the governor’s move raises legal questions.

“It’s not clear to me that a defendant in a lawsuit… can simply walk away from a lawsuit or withdraw,” he said.

I won’t speak to the legal side of this issue because I’m not up to speed on it, but I really have to wonder what kind of person would seek to prevent two people who are in a relationship from making whatever arrangements they want to allow the other to visit them in the hospital, and what right the state has to tell hospitals that they cannot honor those requests.

Is the GOP hatred for gays so pervasive that they could really be this cold and heartless?</p>

<p>Can someone explain this to me in plain English?  Is this good or bad?  I can never figure out Net Neutrality.  I'm not usually like this.

----

This would be just the third veto Barack Obama has made, but the White House says today that he’ll go there if the Senate on Thursday endorses a bill to upend the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The resolution to scrap the regulations — which are due to take effect on November 20 — is similar to one that the House passed in April. The Senate vote could be close: Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchinson’s bill has 42 co-sponsors. Supporters include Maine Republican Olympia Snowe, who favors net neutrality but says the issue should be decided by Congress — not the FCC. In today’s “Statement of Administration Policy,” the White House says that “the open Internet enables entrepreneurs to create new services without fear of undue discrimination by network providers.” For example, Comcast wouldn’t be able to favor transmissions over its broadband lines for a service it likes, such as Hulu, over those of a rival such as Netflix. The administration says that disapproval of net neutrality would “threaten the very foundations of innovation in the Internet economy and the democratic spirit that has made the Internet a force for social progress around the world.” If the Senate passes the bill, then the administration statement says “his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the Resolution.” Even if Obama stops a congressional effort to overturn the rules, the FCC will have to defend them in court from a challenge brought by Verizon. The phone company says the FCC doesn’t have the authority to set rules for the Internet.</p>

Look, I never do this -- and I stay with Starwood Hotels almost exclusively when traveling on business. But I would feel like a chump if I said nothing.

Anyway, I ordered a Cobb Salad via room service tonight, and I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw how tiny it was.  Keep in mind that I've ordered this salad from the Westin late night menu in Minneapolis and Columbus on numerous occasions, so I had an idea what to expect. 

I am not sure if this picture really tells the story, but long story short, you guys barely sent up a side salad tonight... for which I had the privilege of paying $28 including tip.

It didn't even come with the dressing given in the room service menu.  Ranch swapped out with blue cheese without any warning or courtesy call that you were out of the advertised dressing. 

Like I said, I never do this, but it was THAT bad.

<p>Mo'nique claims that she now knows why the offers didn't start flooding in after her big Oscar win in 2010.

The former star of The Parkers, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the title character's abusive, domineering mother in Precious, writes in an essay in the Feb. 27 issue of The Hollywood Reporter that director-producer Lee Daniels clued her in just a few months ago.

Noting that an Oscar win "normally does" lead to "more respect, choices, money" in the business, Mo'Nique writes, "But I got a phone call from Lee Daniels...And he said to me, 'Mo'Nique, you've been blackballed.' I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Because you didn't play the game.'" 

After steamrolling the competition throughout the 2009-10 awards season, Mo'Nique famously didn't campaign for her Oscar, going on to say in her acceptance speech that she was grateful to the Academy "for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics."

"I said, 'Well, what game is that?'" her THR piece continues. "He gave me no response."

People who would say that she's "difficult," "tactless" or "tacky" would "probably be right," the actress writes. "That's why I have my beautiful husband because he's so full of tact. I'm just a girl from Baltimore. But being from that place, you learn not to let anybody take advantage of you."

Since co-starring in Precious with Gabourey Sidibe, Lenny Kravitz and an unrecognizable Mariah Carey, the 47-year-old actress only has a few credits to her name, none of them major theatrical releases.

Mo'Nique also writes that she was offered the role of Forest Whitaker's wife in Lee Daniels' The Butler, a part that ultimately went to Oprah Winfrey; a role in the Daniels-produced Fox hit Empire; and the role of Richard Pryor's grandmother [also now set to be played by Oprah] in the upcoming biopic Daniels is working on—but, she adds, "they all just went away."

In response to Mo'Nique, Daniels said in a statement to THR: "Mo'Nique is a creative force to be reckoned with. Her demands through Precious were not always in line with the campaign. This soured her relationship with the Hollywood community. I consider her a friend. I have and will always think of her for parts that we can collaborate on, however the consensus among the creative teams and powers thus far were to go another way with these roles."</p>

<p>Hunter Moore, the operator of a US “revenge porn” website that hosted stolen nude photos, has pled guilty to hacking and identity theft.

Moore could face a prison sentence of between two and seven years for the offences. He signed court papers stating that he had paid another man, whom he named as Charles Evens, to hack websites to steal photos.

Evens has pleaded not guilty and will face trial in March.

Moore is due in court on February 25. The hearing could be postponed until March.

His website, IsAnyoneUp, hosted pictures of naked women, posted without their consent. It featured pictures of the daughter of a major Republican political donor and an American Idol finalist, before it was taken down in April 2012.

Moore claimed the site was yielding $10,000 a month in revenues. But following a barrage of criticism, he sold the site to an anti-bullying group.

“I am burned out and I honestly can’t take another underage kid getting submitted and having to go through the process of reporting it and dealing with all the legal drama of that situation,” he wrote when he sold the site.

He was arrested in January last year.</p>

NEW YORK (MYFOXNY) -

A traveler, apparently upset when asked to remove his belt, decided to make sure he would not set off the metal detector by stripping naked at the security check point.

It happened at Pulkovo Airport in St. Persburg, Russia.

Security video of the incident showed the man start by taking off his shoes. He then removed his pants and then his shirt and his watch.

The man did leave his socks on.

After calmly walking through the check point the man puts his watch back on before grabbing his clothes and walking off.

Police are reportedly investigating the incident, although security personnel at the scene didn't seem too bothered by the entire incident.</p>

<p>I mean really now, without the jokes, do you actually believe she''s a lesbian?  I don''t have dyke-ar, so I really don''t know.

I don't get much variety of birds visiting here.  Occasionally I get Blue Jays,  who are easily spooked.  I had a dove nest on my window sill recently, and I had a hawk visit once.  The hawk made a God-awful screeching sound.  I hope he didn't eat the dove.</p>

<p>My old neighbors, two doctors, have been getting a divorce now for 8 years.  This straight couple was only married for 10 years.

The lawyers keep pushing them each into contesting what the other proposes.  The judges keeps sending them to counselor after counselor for assessments (with one full multi-session assessment costing $40,000!).

One has spent about $800,000 and the other about $1 million. It's the husband who is insane and is push this constantly. He seems not to realize the amount he's spending and the courts just keep on churning.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14972070">Libertarian political theory </a></strong>
<p>
Libertarian means-

--Never initiating force. Self-defense ONLY if there is no path to walk away.

--Never lying with the intent to defraud. "Does this dress make me look fat" versus "should we tell the American people that Saddam has WMDs and bombed the WTC"

--Never stealing, or allowing anyone to steal for you. If I can't come to your house and take half your paycheck, then I cannot authorize the government to do it on my behalf.

--Never cheating, by giving someone with a title like "judge" or "officer" or "president" the ability to break the law without consequence.

These 4 things are the essence of libertarianism.

It's so sad that the deluded fucktards here have to twist and lie and misrepresent a philosophy that is so easy to understand.

Plus, when you begin to explore the economic aspects- explained by Menger, Bohm von Bawerk, Mises and Rothbard- the whole system of a morally just, peaceful, productive, cooperative and beautiful way of seeing the world and treating others peacefully and respectfully...well, it's an amazing thing. I'm so glad I rejected the evil socialist/communist Democrats and the Neocon crony capitalist Republicans as a teenager.

If you believe in peace, fairness, prosperity, charity, equality and brotherhood then libertarianism is the ONLY way to achieve it. Every other system ends with a gun in your face and blood on your hands.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=11074872">What is the appeal of daytime soap operas?</a></strong>
<p>Serious question.

I assume it's tradition and/or force of habit, right?

When I was a kid in the 80s, my family watched AMC and, during the summers, I did too.  I understand the appeal of episodic television (and tradition).  But I gave it up by the time I was a teen.  Even my mom - who is now elderly and mostly housebound - gave up on daytime soaps a decade ago.

Today, when you can spend your TV time watching pretty much anything, why do people still cling to these cheap, poorly written, terribly acted relics that take up five hours a week?

The thread below spurred my post.  I nearly laughed out loud when, in one stirring screed, someone wrote this.  About daytime soaps.  "As far as so-called changing demographics, why must TV networks, and producers of movies, feel they must always appeal to the lowest common denominator?"</p>

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14901890">Excuses Fat People Give For Being Morbidly Obese Monstrosities </a></strong>
<p>1. I'm "big-boned". 

2. I have a slow metabolism. (This claim has been tested time and again and there's no such thing as a slow metabolism. When obese patients are monitored and compared with skinny people their metabolism are burning calories exactly the same. The difference is that the morbidly obese individual consumes drastically more calories than a skinny person.)

3. I have an (unspecified) medical condition (very few medical conditions cause one to be fat. There are diseases that can cause fluid retention and such, but few cause one to get fat.)

4. I was molested.

5. It's genetics.

6. I don't make enough money to eat healthy.

7. My medication makes me fat. (There are some medication that can cause weight gain. However, doctors are quick to switch patients to other drugs if they notice this problem developing.)

8. I had an injury which limits my activity. 

9. I'm diabetic. (Yes, certain people would have us believe that it was their diabetes that caused them to become morbidly obese and not the other way around.)

10. I have a thyroid condition. (Very rare. The majority of thyroid conditions cause a hyperactive metabolism, keeping someone super skinny. However, even if a person does have a genuine thyroid issue, treatment is effective which will end weight gain.)

11. Fatorexia, the tendency for fat people to perceive themselves as not being fat. Women who believe they are merely "curvy" or "big and beautiful" fall into this category as well. The fatty from "My Big Fat Fabulous Life" falls into this category as well as number 3 as she blames her weight gain on a medical condition and not the fact that she likely consumes 10,000 calories or more a day. 

12. I was teased or bullied as a kid.

13. It's society's fault or society should accept me for how I am. 

14. I had a kid, or multiple kids. (As if this is a free pass to be a blob for the rest of your life.)</p>

Simply write a capital r, then the number of the post. It's important to:

2. Leave NO space between the R and the number of the post you want to refer to.

<p>This has gotten way, way out of control.

And none of the other ambassadors pay it either.  And ambassadors do not pay any similar fees in other countries as well.

Our "leaders" are always telling us we should obey all the laws of a host country, but yet they don't have to because of the stupid diplomatic immunity.  It was NEVER set up to be abused like this.</p>

</a></strong>
<p>Daily Mail.com

[italic]Radio 1 has banned Madonna for being 'irrelevant and old' for its listeners

The 56-year-old singer has been dropped from the station's playlist 

The singer's latest single has been available since December 20 last year

It has only been played on the station ONCE since its release[/italic]

  
She has dominated the airwaves during 30 years as a chart-topper, but now Radio 1 has decided that Madonna is an immaterial girl and just too old for its teenage listeners.

Despite her determined efforts to look – and sound – youthful, the 56-year-old has been dropped from the station’s playlist that determines which songs are played by DJs during the day.

Madonna’s latest song is Living For Love and has been available for airplay since December 20 last year.

Yet it has been played on Radio 1 just once – on January 9 when DJ Annie Mac played it on her evening show. But that was after 7pm, when songs not on the playlist can be broadcast.

The track is the first single from the mother of four’s new album, Rebel Heart. The station last night said the single had been omitted from playlists on the basis of ‘audience relevance’ and ‘musical merit’.

A Radio 1 insider said: ‘At the end of the day it’s all about relevance. It’s natural that as an artist gets older their audience goes elsewhere and Radio 1 has to reflect that.

‘The station has a duty to meet the needs of younger listeners. I don’t think the audience is losing sleep that it is not playing Madonna in the same way that it used to.’

The snub represents a remarkable fall from grace for the star who notched up 13 UK No 1s between 1985 and 2008. She finds herself alongside Sir Cliff Richard, Take That, Kate Bush and Robbie Williams on a long list of artists who struggle to get new material played on the station.

Madonna’s single is being played on Radio 2, which caters for an audience aged over 35. By contrast, Sir Paul McCartney’s new single will be played by Radio 1 even though the former Beatle is 72. This is because the track is a collaboration with rapper Kanye West, 37, and pop mega-star Rihanna, 26.

A Radio 1 spokesman said: ‘Tracks are chosen on musical merit, and while around 40 per cent of the country’s 15 to 29-year-olds tune into Radio 1 each week, an artist’s age is never a factor.’

Madonna’s spokesman declined to comment.</p>

<p>Vanilla Ice Charged in Burglary Near TV Show Location

February 18, 2015 | 12:45PM PT, Alex Stedman, News Editor, Variety.com

Vanilla Ice has been charged in connection with a home burglary in Lantana, Fla., adjacent to where he was renovating a home for his reality show “The Vanilla Ice Project,” authorities confirm.

Ice — the stage name of Robert Van Winkle — was taken into custody Wednesday and is being charged with burglary and grand theft in connection with an incident that happened sometime within the past month, said Lantana police chief Sean Scheller. Numerous items of furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and more were stolen.

According to a Lantana police press release, during an investigation into the house adjacent to the one Ice was renovating, authorities obtained a search warrant and found several of the stolen items at Ice’s residence in Palm Beach County, determining that the former rapper “played a role” in the crime. The items have since been identified and returned to the rightful owner.

Scheller said Ice has been cooperative in investigations. Ice has hosted his series on the DIY Network, where he improves and flips houses, since 2010.

TMZ first reported the news.</p>

<p>Accident, my ass.  Bitch had it coming.

"Authorities in northern Idaho say a 2-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed his mother after he reached into her purse at a Walmart store and the concealed gun fired.

Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller tells reporters that the shooting was accidental and occurred in the store in Hayden, Idaho, a town about 40 miles northeast of Spokane, Washington.

Authorities say the woman was shopping in the electronics department with what are believed to be her four children Tuesday morning when the accident happened. While many outlets have reported that the woman was the toddler's mother, conflicting reports say the relationship between the two has not yet been verified.

They say she was visiting from out of town, looking to spend some gift cards the family received over the holidays.

Miller says the woman had a concealed weapons permit. Her identity has not been released, as authorities wait to inform her family. 

The Walmart was evacuated and closed after the shooting, and there was no word when it would be reopen. 

Hayden is a politically conservative town of about 9,000 people just north of Coeur d'Alene in Idaho's northern panhandle."</p>

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14976695">Libertarianism means...</a></strong>
<p>--Never initiating force. Self-defense ONLY if there is no path to walk away.

--Never lying with the intent to defraud. "Does this dress make me look fat" versus "should we tell the American people that Saddam has WMDs and bombed the WTC"

--Never stealing, or allowing anyone to steal for you. If I can't come to your house and take half your paycheck, then I cannot authorize the government to do it on my behalf.

--Never cheating, by giving someone with a title like "judge" or "officer" or "president" the ability to break the law without consequence.

These 4 things are the essence of libertarianism.

Instead of "top-down" government, we believe in "bottom-up" spontaneous order and organization. Like nature. 

It's so sad that the deluded fucktards here have to twist and lie and misrepresent a philosophy that is so easy to understand.

Plus, when you begin to explore the economic aspects- explained by Menger, Bohm von Bawerk, Mises and Rothbard- the whole system of a morally just, peaceful, productive, cooperative and beautiful way of seeing the world and treating others peacefully and respectfully...well, it's an amazing thing. I'm so glad I rejected the evil socialist/communist Democrats and the Neocon crony capitalist Republicans as a teenager.

If you believe in peace, fairness, prosperity, charity, equality and brotherhood then libertarianism is the ONLY way to achieve it. Every other system ends with a gun in your face and blood on your hands.</p>

<p>Gay neighborhoods may be on the decline, but at least group in San Francisco isn’t going down without a fight.

A new leather-themed cruising ground park may soon be coming to the city by the bay.

The proposed park, which is being called the “Eagle Plaza,” would be located in the heart of the city’s SOMA neighborhood, an area known for its gay leather bars and nightclubs, as well as for hosting kinky events like Folsom Street Fair and Dore Alley.

“This would provide an active hub for the LGBTQ community and added green space for the immediate neighborhood,” said project manager Hannah Smith.

The block-long “active hub” would be built right outside the Eagle bar and would be appropriately decked out in the colors of the leather flag–blue, black, white and red. It would feature spots for food trucks, picnic tables and chairs, benches, planters, and “jungle gyms” (wink, wink.)

“I am super excited about it,” said District 6 Supervisor Jane Kim, whose office participated in the initial talks about the proposed plaza. “I think it is beautiful.”

As an added bonus, across the street, developers hope to build an apartment complex, which would be perfect for voyeurs and leather daddies alike. Between the apartment, the park, and the Eagle bar, they’d never have to leave the neighborhood.

“There is a lack of public space like this in this area,” said Alex Montiel, a co-owner of the Eagle bar. “Something like this is very much needed for anybody who lives around here. There are no parks nearby.”</p>

<p>Last night I went to a screening of Billy Wilder's classic "Sunset Blvd" at The Magnolia Theatre in Dallas; of course, it's a great treat to see a classic movie on the big screen, but so is the possibility to see it with an audience, as the energy in the room can have a profound impact on one's response to the film.

In this case, I'd seen "Sunset Blvd" on television a couple of times, where I appreciated it as a tragic noir melodrama; this time, however, surrounded by other film fans, we found ourselves laughing throughout the film. I know the film is considered black comedy, but I hadn't realize how really funny the film is until this.

Indeed, many of us were surprised at our laughter and were wondering if the movie was intended to be funny, that audiences in 1950 would've appreciated the film as a comedy, or if we're projecting our modern camp sensibilities on the film.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14986991">Fox News: America is ‘behind’ because science class wastes time on the lack of black physicists</a></strong>
<p>A Fox News “Trouble With Schools” segment suggested on Wednesday that U.S. kids were behind in the world because a physics teacher in Seattle had tried to teach a lesson to privileged white students on why there were not more black physicists.

“This probably wasn’t on the curriculum in your high school physics class,” Fox News host Elisabeth Hasselbeck announced. “A high school physics teacher came up with new six-day curriculum that includes lessons on white privilege. He says it will prepare students for institutional racism and social justice! So, what does that have to with physics exactly?”

“It’s not an open mic night in these classrooms,” the National Review‘s Katherine Timpf opined. “You don’t get to decide you can talk about anything you want to these students. It has to be about what your class is. Physics class, you talk about physics. Really, it’s that simple.”

But in a guest post at the Quantum Progress blog, University Prep school physics teacher Moses Rifkin explained exactly how his lesson was important at a private school where students “weren’t learning about their own privilege (academic and, in most cases, economic and racial).”

“I’ve found a way to introduce my students to the ideas of racial and gender privilege, to the idea that our society is far from a meritocracy, and to broaden their conception of who (racially, gender-wise, etc.) does science to include a much broader slice of society,” he wrote. “The project revolves, at least initially, around a question: why are there so few black[1] physicists? [..] Physicists therefore make up a small percentage of the U.S. population (0.06%), but that percentage is 3.2 times higher among white Americans than black.”

This was not enough to convince Timpf.

“Physics class!” she exclaimed. “He said he was jealous that all the other teachers got to talk about society — English, History — then he also said they’re not learning about. Which one is it?”

“I don’t’ know what this is really about,” Timpf continued. “I guess it’s just his own agenda. He wants to talk about it.”

“But you know what? We’re consistently behind in science in math of other developed countries in high school. Maybe it’s because physics teachers aren’t teaching physics in their classes.”

“Well, yeah,” Hasselbeck agreed. “They’re asking things like this. Part of their pre-project homework was learn about the pre-1950s and modern blacks physicists, Peggy McIntosh’s ‘white privilege’ and then listen to Macklemore.”

The Fox News host added that the prep school said that it was “fully aware of and support Mr. Rifkin’s work with his students and part of our commitment to provide our students an education that helps grow into socially responsible, intellectually courageous citizens of the world.”

“How about teaching them physics in physics class?” Timpf scoffed. “Because you do need that too.”

In his guest post at Quantum Progress, Rifkin asserted that learning about social justice and the need for black scientists was necessary for the improvement of science in the country as a whole.

“Beyond the very concrete step of showing that not all physicists are, to use my students’ phrase, ‘dead white dudes’, I have a lot of less visible goals,” he noted. “I hope that my students can see that the lack of black physicists is a problem regardless of their own race, and that it likely reflects some broader themes in our society.””

They also argue their lives are just fine, thank you.  They say they're different; not disordered.  But Aspies don't understand how frustrating they are to the rest of us because they have the disorder.  I say parents should be able to selectively abort.</p>

<p>JEFFERSON — An Ashtabula native soap opera star was charged Friday with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and vehicular assault, according to the Ashtabula County Prosecutor’s office.

Freddie M. Smith, 26, was legally drunk Oct. 7 when he crashed his car on Route 84 in Kingsville Township, according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol.

His girlfriend, actress Alyssa Tabit, 27, of North Hollywood, Calif., was seriously injured in the crash, according to OHP reports.

Smith’s blood alcohol test result was .093, when the legal limit in Ohio is .08, according to OHP reports.

Vehicular assault is a fourth-degree felony, and the OVI charge is a first-degree misdemeanor, Ashtabula County Assistant Prosecutor Cecilia Cooper said.

An arraignment date has not been set, she said.

Smith, who now lives in Los Angeles, Calif., lost control of the Mazda 6 he was driving on a curve in the road, just east of Dibble Road, according to the OHP report.

OHP troopers suspected speed and alcohol were factors in the crash.

Tabit is recovering from her injuries.

Troopers received the results from Smith’s blood alcohol test on Monday.

Smith plays the part of Sonny Kiriakis on the daytime soap opera, “Days of Our Lives.”

According to OHP, Smith’s car crossed the center line at about 12:40 a.m. Oct. 7, traveled to the left side of the road and hit a culvert, causing the vehicle to flip end over end.

When the vehicle came to rest, Tabit was temporarily trapped inside. She was flown by medical helicopter to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital and underwent surgery. She is recovering from her injuries.

Smith was treated and released from UH Conneaut Medical Center for minor injuries.

They were in town visiting Smith’s family.

According to his fan page, Smith is back on the set in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Kelly Clarkson is feeling a little left out!

The "Heartbeat Song" crooner stopped by BBC Radio 1 to chat with Nick Grimshaw earlier today and complained about not being able to get other singers to work with her on her upcoming album, Piece By Piece.

"I honestly would collaborate with a lot of people, but everyone usually says no," the Grammy-winner admitted. "I'm not kidding you. I have legitimately asked several people that I'm not going to call out, and that's cool, but I don't know."

The new mama continued, "I ask good people, I don't want to sing with crap people, so I mean, I ask people who are great vocalists, but I'm not going to point out anyone. I have asked several people…Sometimes I feel like I have the plague, or leprosy, they're like, 'If you get too close…' I don't know."

The former American Idol star did mention that one famous face agreed to get into the studio with her: John Legend!

"I got John Legend to say yes, and he's cool. I can get country artists to sing with me and John Legend! I'm gonna keep John Legend. He's super credible and talented. I feel very good about myself with that one."

And despite not being able to get every singer of her choosing on board with her upcoming music, Clarkson has worked with many a talented artist in the past including stepmother-in-law Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, and Jason Aldean.

"I feel like I'm a very nice person that you might want to sing with me," she shared before confessing that she hasn't taken the rejection too seriously. Attagirl!</p>

<p>A broody young woman killed herself after she struggled with the fact she was unmarried and had no children by the age of 30.

Hospital administrator Rachel Gow, 29, had wanted to walk up the aisle and have a family of her own but became "troubled" that she achieved neither.

As her 30th birthday approached the self-confessed "dizzy blonde" she said felt other members of her family were "doing better than her."

Fearing her boyfriend Anton Tsvarev, 30 would leave her, Miss Gow sent him a test message wishing him "all the best for the future" before poisoning herself at her home. Mr Tsvarev who had been visiting a friend later found Miss Gow but she died despite attempts by him to revive her.

An inquest was told Miss Gow, from Haslingden, Lancashire, had been an "outgoing, adventurous and loving" young woman who had attained a 2:1 in History from Lancaster University before working at Royal Bolton Hospital.</p>

 gay lovers  Agron  and Nasir 

Who's watching this Friday at 9?</a></strong>
<p>[quote]“We’ve had gay characters on the show before, but this was the first time that we could develop the relationship from the very beginning very slowly and actually see them fall in love,” said Spartacus creator Steven S. DeKnight of the love story that began last season with rebel warriors Agron (played with hunky bravado by Dan Feuerriegel) and Nasir (Pana Hema Taylor), a.k.a. ‘Nagron.’

On a press call late last week, DeKnight previewed what we’ll see when the War Of The Damned chapter (the final season in the series) begins airing this Friday on Starz. “We continue exploring their relationship,” he said, adding the tease that “you can’t always have a relationship that goes smoothly. There’s not a lot of drama in that, so we throw a couple of curve balls at them. But theirs is one of the relationships that, I think, is really kind of the cornerstone of the season. There are a lot of relationships going on and theirs, I think, is particularly powerful and gut-wrenching and beautiful.”

And for his alleged great taste in talent, he still couldn't even grasp the concept that women and minorities could be just as funny as straight white men up until about ten years ago.   

It's funny how most alumni have bitched and moaned about how horrible and stressful an atmosphere it was, but make sure to kiss Lorne's ass at every opportunity.  Well, if he was so great, than why did your time on the show suck so much?

<p>Just like Snoop Dogg...er, Lion, who supported Ron Paul, another major hip hop artist has embraced libertarianism!

-----

In a recent interview on HuffPost Live, Georgia native and former  member of the hip-hop duo OutKast,  Antwan “Big Boi” Patton said he voted for the Libertarian Presidential candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, breaking the many in the industry who supported President Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate.

Big Boi, who apparently marches to his own drummer, said he had nothing against Mr. Obama saying, “he’s a nice guy, but you know, the things that they’re standing on right now just didn’t agree with me”.

“I’m a Libertarian. I’m liberty, justice for all, liberty for all. I’m really pro-people, pro-freedom, and, you know, this is all about positivity”, Patton said.

During the interview, Big Boi recounted an encounter with a white lady the day after the election.

“Well, I was, you know, leaving to go out of town, and it was a lady — a Caucasian lady — and she was like, ‘Oh yeah, congratulations on y’all win last night,’ you know, with like an attitude,” Big Boi recalled. “And, you know, just to let her know I was on my P’s and Q’s, I was like, ‘I don’t know what you talkin’ bout, I voted for Gary Johnson.’ And she looked shocked to even know that I knew there were other candidates on the ballot, you know what I’m saying? So, you can’t judge a book by its cover.”

Gary Johnson garnered about 1.27 million votes on November 6, 2012.

Last January, Libertarian leaning Republican Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul received a quasi-endorsement from rapper Snoop Dogg.

Snoop  posted a photo of Paul on his Facebook page Sunday with the headline “Smoke Weed Everyday.” The caption of the photo reads a simple “Because I said so.”

His action was certainly due to Paul’s consistent stance on the decriminalization of marijuana he held throughout his career.</p>

</a></strong>
<p>FALLBROOK, Calif. — The FBI is taking over the search for a Southern California family that has been missing for 3 years, officials say.

Joseph McStay, his wife Summer, and their 2 young sons Gianni and Joseph were last heard from on February 4, 2010.

In a statement Tuesday, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said it pursued hundreds of leads to find Joseph and Summer McStay and their sons.

The investigation is being turned over to the FBI due to the agency’s experience working outside the United States.

Its believed the family likely went to Mexico voluntarily, but relatives aren’t convinced.

Investigators say that on Jan. 28, days before they disappeared, someone used the McStay’s computer to find information about travel to Mexico and passports for children.

The McStay’s white 1996 Izuzu Trooper was found abandoned February 8th in San Ysidro.

Detectives also uncovered video from a border crossing showing a group of people similar to the McStay family going into Mexico through the pedestrian gate.

The video is dated around 7 p.m. Feb. 8, the same day the Trooper was found.

Detectives showed the video to the McStay’s relatives.

Some recognized the white jacket that the woman is wearing in the video, but other family members aren’t sure it’s them because of the poor quality of the video.

Since their disappearance, investigators said, the McStays haven’t used their bank accounts, credit cards or cell phones.

Family members maintain the McStays would never have left on vacation or for any other reason without telling someone.

“Evidence at the family home suggested that the family had not left on a planned vacation and that the totality of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance was quite out of character for this family,” sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Brugos said.

The family dogs had been left without food or water.

Food was found on the kitchen counter and two cereal bowls full of popcorn were in the living room.

“Certainly it’s not against the law to be missing voluntarily but we are checking some things preliminarily such as their banking, cell phone use, to try to make a determination on what happened,” said Lt. Dennis Brugos.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=13454113">So what's everyone's take on this [an important drug google will not allow us to mention] as a prophylaxis against getting HIV?</a></strong>
<p>I'm 50 years old, and pretty alarmed at how many young guys I know who have sero-converted. Condom use has not caught on with the guys who weren't around to experience the big 1983-1996 AIDS die off.

I'm figuring that the population who may benefit from a drug like this may often be in less than perfect health to start with, and if one can't use a damned condom, how likely is one to faithfully stay on a drug regimen? What might be the long-term effects?

I was initially horrified to think anyone would take a potent HIV drug while perfectly healthy, and risk the side effects (and feeding into Big Pharma's profit scheme), just so they can continue barebacking.....but what if that's just my prejudice? What if ultimately it saves lives?</p>

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=12146562">Jensen Ackles is a (Homophobic) Douchebag</a></strong>
<p>Out of all the homophobic actors out there--and I’m sure their numbers are legion--Jensen Ackles irritates me the most.  I don’t understand the gay men who worship him.  He’s undeniably good looking but he can’t open his mouth without making a homophobic comment.  What kills me is that gays everywhere take up for him just because of his looks.  “Oh, he didn’t mean it that way;” or “Oh, it was just a joke;” or “Oh, you’re taking his comments too literally;” bullshit like that.  

Are you fuckin’ kiddin’ me???  I’m sorry but affecting a lispy high-pitched voice while ineffectually slapping at someone OVER AND OVER AND OVER, TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME, IN EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRIVED SITUATION isn’t funny.  It isn’t a joke.  And, similarly, using the word “gay” or “pansy” as a derogatory adjective in interviews isn’t okay either.  Those things are evidence of a belief, people, an attitude toward gays, and I’m sick of guys lusting over him.   I’m 46 and own my own architectural firm, and I have 6 architects working for me.  Two of them are gay and about 10 years younger than me, and I had listen to them all goddam night go on about this guy.  Even on DataLounge his name pops up constantly.  It’s like a bunch of freakin’ yeshiva boys jonesin’ to blow motherfuckin’ Hitler.

I don’t know what Ackles makes per episode, but word is that he clears 40k to 50k for an appearance at a “Supernatural” convention.  So far this year he’s done twelve.  On top of that, once he’s there he charges for meet-and-greets and photo ops, and it’s gays who are putting a lot of that money in his pocket.  (Unless you’re [i]too[i/] gay.  Then there’s no photo because he won’t pose with you.)  Gays are also the ones glued to their tv sets each week, boosting his show’s ratings while they queer every gaze between him and his on-screen brother.  [i]Idiots.[i/] 

This guy doesn’t even have the testicular fortitude of Sabrina the Teenage Witch!  He won’t just come out and say what he thinks about gays, gay marriage or even politics because he knows it would hurt his career.  In fact, his wife will re-Tweet stuff showing mild LGBT support just to muddy the waters and throw people, most likely Hollywood producers, off their GOP scent.  However, the latest is that Stone Park Trust, the same trust that owns his Brentwood property--the same trust for which he’s the trustee--has allegedly made past donations to NOM, Prop 8 and Romney’s campaign, so anyone who thinks Ackles isn’t a Republican is nuts.  His wife’s Twitter page practically spells it out, along with their very devout “I love me some Jesus” status.  “Jensen’s favorite book is the Bible;” “His favorite actor is Jim Caviezel;” “His favorite time of year is Easter.”  Blah, blah, blah.  

Man, I got nothing against anyone’s religion or their personal beliefs about gays and lesbians.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, is entitled to their own opinions, but that doesn’t mean that I have to buy their product or watch their show.  I’m not going to further any actor’s career so they can fight harder against my rights.  And I’m sure not going to give someone like Ackles a starring role in my fantasies.  I mean, compare his douchebaggery with the incredibly respectful and classy comments George Clooney made about constantly being called gay.  Night and day.  Night and day.

<p>The movie "Fifty Shades of Grey" is rated R, but in Sacramento, some kids were getting a gee-whiz gander of the film in its graphic-nudity glory.

Drive-in-movie screens, thousands of square feet in area, over the weekend were showing the film, which is based on the racy, wildly successful book that focuses on a man's S&M obsession.

The movie, playing at Sacramento 6, is rated R for "strong sexual content, including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity, and for language."

And it is clearly visible from Highway 50.

One set of parents came to the drive-in to celebrate their son's 10th birthday. The boy and his 12-year-old brother "were very interested watching it coming in," said John Schmidt of Sacramento.

The moviegoer added: "I'd think it's a safety issue, people trying to sneak a peek as they are going 70 miles an hour down the freeway and not looking where they are supposed to be going."

Fox 40 contacted the theater manager, who said she wasn't quite sure what the policy was regarding sexual content on their screens. She forwarded the question to her general manager, who did not immediately respond.</p>

<p>Nevada Assemblywoman Michelle Fiore (R) believes that if college campuses allowed students to carry guns, young women would be better able to prevent sexual assault.

Fiore introduced a bill in the Nevada Assembly last week that would allow individuals with concealed carry permits to bring their firearms onto campuses in the state.

The assemblywoman cited safety as one of her concerns when she introduced the bill, and told the New York Times in an interview published Wednesday that the bill could help prevent rape.

"If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them. The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head," she said.

According to the Times, lawmakers have introduced similar bills in 10 states, including Florida and Texas. And gun rights activists have encouraged lawmakers to push these bills.

"The gun lobby has seized on this tactic, this subject of sexual assault," Andy Pelosi, the executive director of the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, told the Times. "It resonates with lawmakers."

John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor and president of One in Four, a group that teaches college students about sexual assault, told the Times that guns will not likely help women prevent rape.

"It reflects a misunderstanding of sexual assaults in general," Foubert said. "If you have a rape situation, usually it starts with some sort of consensual behavior, and by the time it switches to nonconsensual, it would be nearly impossible to run for a gun. Maybe if it’s someone who raped you before and is coming back, it theoretically could help them feel more secure."</p>

<p>We’re eager to see Marvel’s new slate of TV shows for Netflix, especially Daredevil. As we recall, the blind vigilante has a supersuit that leaves little to the imagination (and was the best thing about the Ben Affleck movie from 2003).

Charlie Cox, the English actor who plays DD, revealed getting his costume on is no mean feat:

It’s pretty tight, I’m not going to lie. They’ve done such a great job. I can’t wait for fans to really see it. But put it this way, there is no world where you change in a phone box. It takes four people and about 45 minutes…

They’re very clever about it. You get three zippers. You zip them all up, but when you have to wee, you just have to zip one down—the wee zipper.

Considering Cox’s character, Matt Murdock, is blind, we’d be more than happy to help him with his wee zipper.

The last comment is a bit cringe-worthy, IMO.</p>

Kelly has a great voice, and she sells records. But she has never become a pop star of the first rank (like Pink, Katy, and Taylor), and she's never had a big arena tour. I wonder if her weight is holding her back. Of course, being big hasn't heard Adele, but Adele is British and there is a different set of rules for Brits.</p>

[quote]See, somewhere along the line, SNL became the buddy who makes you say, "I love him, but I wish he wouldn't do (fill in 20 different things)." It's the show that cares far too much about the culture of celebrity, about the sound of a studio audience reacting to the mere sight of a famous person with urgent applause. It repeats sketches too much and never takes enough chances. It's funny and frustrating and predictable and inventive and generic. It's last night. And if you think I am deleting it from my DVR anytime soon, you're crazy.</p>

<p>House Speaker John Boehner committed a crime when he invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to a joint session of Congress, and now he is freely admitting that he not only did so behind President Obama’s back, he did so to sabotage delicate peace talks with Iran.

During an interview on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Boehner confessed that he knew the White House wouldn’t appreciate a foreign leader being brought in to wreck diplomatic efforts to keep Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, so he did so in secret to prevent President Obama from nixing the GOP plan to undermine him.

Of course, Boehner denied that he did anything wrong despite the fact that there is a 1799 law still on books known as the Logan Act which forbids unauthorized US citizens from negotiating with foreign leaders. Only the executive branch has that authority.

WALLACE: “Haven’t you taken one of the few bipartisan issues in this country — support for Israel — and turned it into a political football?”

BOEHNER: “I have not. The fact is that we had every right to do what we did. I wanted the prime minister to come here. There’s a serious threat facing the world. And radical Islamic terrorists are not going to go away. And then when it comes to the threat of Iran having a nuclear weapon, these are important messages that the Congress needs to hear and the American people need to hear. And I believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu is the perfect person to deliver the message of how serious this threat is.”

Wallace asked Boehner why he would circumvent the White House like that, and the Republican couldn’t resist confessing. He also accused the Obama Administration of being hostile towards Netanyahu.

“Because I wanted to make sure that there was no interference. There’s no secret here in Washington about the animosity that this White House has for Prime Minister Netanyahu. I frankly didn’t want that getting in the way, quashing what I thought was a real opportunity.”

Boehner also claimed that the American people need to hear Netanyahu demonize the diplomatic talks between the US and Iran. You know, because peace amounts to supporting terrorism in the eyes of Natanyahu and his Republican puppets.

Here’s the video via YouTube.

Let’s face it. It’s time for us to re-evaluate our relationship with Israel, and the $3 billion of military aid we provide them every year to commit acts of genocide with. This is a serious breach of US protocol and American law. It’s also seriously troublesome that Republicans have more loyalty to a foreign leader than they do to their own Commander-in-Chief, especially when you consider the fact that the GOP is gleeful about letting Netanyahu speak to Congress when they were actually considering banning President Obama from delivering his State of the Union Address back in November. Clearly, Republicans think Netanyahu is the real President of the United States and that’s a threat to our own autonomy that the American people must not tolerate.</p>

</a></strong>
<p>New York, NY (Top40 Charts) 

Back before her 1986 breakthrough, "Control," then-teenage Janet Jackson was still mostly known as Michael's Little Sister. That changed when Janet released her iconic single "What Have You Done for Me Lately" in February of 1986, the song earned Jackson two Grammy nominations and a Soul Train Music Award for Video of the Year, since then Janet Jackson and has been a record-breaking, history setting icon who has sold over 130 million albums and singles worldwide.

Billboard's latest Hottest Hot 100 Hits book lists four of the five biggest selling singles by the Jackson family are by Janet, surprisingly not her legendary brother Michael. Her massive 1993 hit "That's the Way Love Goes" is the biggest selling single of all the Jackson family members, while her 2001 hit "All for You" is the second biggest selling single. Looks like Janet was the one really in control.

<p>Shades of Snowpiercer.

I know global warming gets all the attention, but global cooling would be far worse. 

We are living in an interglacial era. Every time the world gets closer to our current peak, it quickly plunges into another ice age. These interglacial periods appear to have some correlation with sunspot activity. The latest news on sunspot activity is similar to other cold spells. 

Although sunspot data only goes back a few hundred years, the "mini-ice age" from 1250-1850 leads to this detail-

[quote]…if history is a guide, it is safe to say that weak solar activity for a prolonged period of time can have a negative impact on global temperatures in the troposphere which is the bottom-most layer of Earth’s atmosphere - and where we all live. There have been two notable historical periods with decades-long episodes of low solar activity. The first period is known as the “Maunder Minimum”, named after the solar astronomer Edward Maunder, and it lasted from around 1645 to 1715. The second one is referred to as the “Dalton Minimum”, named for the English meteorologist John Dalton, and it lasted from about 1790 to 1830. Both of these historical periods coincided with below-normal global temperatures in an era now referred to by many as the “Little Ice Age”. In addition, research studies in just the past couple of decades have found a complicated relationship between solar activity, cosmic rays, and clouds on Earth. This research suggests that in times of low solar activity where solar winds are typically weak; more cosmic rays reach the Earth’s atmosphere which, in turn, has been found to lead to an increase in certain types of clouds that can act to cool the Earth.

Here is the link that got me thinking. Notice how the planet is at the peak temperature. Hundreds of thousands of years of data, all showing that we are on the cusp of a new ice age.</p>

I really do. I think that it has been very destructive culturally."

<p>When I first came out of the closet, I was emotionally vulnerable and desperate to believe there is actually something called the gay community to embrace me.

I went to Chelsea (NY) because that was gay-central.

I was utterly ignored--not buff, not gorgeous, not wearing the right clothes, etc., I was invisible to them.  I got really depressed, thinking I was rejected by, not only the gay-hater but gays.

It took me a while to get over that funk despite continued rejection from Chelsea types.

Chelsea boys seem to be able to define gay beauty for the world.  First it was buff.  As they grew older and couldn't keep up the gym routines and eyebrow plucking, and suddenly bears with pot bellies became hot.  Now, it's daddies as they've all gotten older.

Fast forward a decade or so, and so many of these same guys have facial wasting from AIDS.  They hit on me all the time because they are desperate for the same kind of attention I wanted.  They now see how hard rejection can be on the soul.

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14302736">Keram Malicki-Sanchez knows...</a></strong>
<p>Keram knows what *really* went down in that Beyonce / Solange elevator fight -- and it sure as fuck ain't what they claimed in that press release. Keram will put it this way: Solange walked into the wrong room at the wrong time, and that night in the elevator, Queen Bey found out she wasn't the *only* queen inside of it. (Bey's flacks have been devising a divorce strategy ever since. Solange and Jay can no longer be in the same room together unsupervised.)

Keram knows that GOOP had to be restrained -- [italic]literally[/italic] -- when she found out her hubby was dating J.Law. (Keram also finds it endlessly amusing that "conscious uncoupling" was used as a euphemism for "famous singer finally dumps crazy-ass bipolar bitch.") Her mommy Blythe is not only used to such rages by now; she had a locked compound built on the grounds of GOOP's Montecito estate over a decade ago to stash her there during flare-ups. When Gwynnie's in one of her "moods," she's kept in its locked-from-the-outside premises with two burly guards on watch 24/7. Her longest compound stay to date clocked in at nearly a month.

Keram knows that two very married stars of the next "Avengers" movie -- stars of the same gender, that is -- had a scorching-hot fling during filming. Not only did their respective wives know about it, one of them joined the festivities one evening! One of them is that bisexual actor who recently renounced his earlier claims of being bi; the other is a "heteroflexible" Brit who seems to have a thing for both mommy *and* daddy types.

Keram knows that Jake Gyllenhaal's family is *quite* concerned about his recent mood swings. He's been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but for inexplicable reasons refuses to take his meds. (No, Jake isn't batshit crazy like GOOP, but still.) Keram has heard talk that the impetus for his downward spiral was Henry Cavill's refusal to return his calls.

Keram knows a certain Hollywood crowd is partying like it's 1989: at a cocaine speakeasy. Yes, you read that correctly. Entry fee at the door -- accessible to members only, and guarded by a Sig Sauer-toting ex-Marine -- is $1,000, and all "tabs" must be paid in cash. These speakeasies come and go, but this one appears to have staying power thanks in large part to its hiding-in-plain-sight location.

Keram knows that Matt McBongo's gone a bit insane in the membrane in his quest to become the Biggest Box Office Star on Earth. Not quite Tammy Cruise insane, mind you -- CO$ isn't involved -- but he's completely given up sex (with men, of course) to maintain the charade of a normal marriage, and he's gone full-tilt Brando before each of his recent roles. Prior to commencing filming on "True Detective," he moved to the deserts of Moab (for two months!!) to become "one with the land." (His PA choppered in weekly with fresh water and food supplies.)

Keram knows that the Bryan Singer lawsuit is effectively over, but Hollywood twinks are attempting all manner of clever devices -- both figurative and literal -- to ensnare Hollywood bigwigs. One of them -- who shall remain nameless, if only because Keram doesn't want the Velvet Mafia hunting his ass down -- hasn't been in anything big yet but has been mentioned on DL a few times. He's over 18; however, his newly out-of-the-closet brother (who isn't an actor) is only 16. Older bro invited younger bro to one of those infamous pool parties at the record mogul's place, and when a certain producer invited him "upstairs," older bro had already set up two high-def "nanny cams" to record the festivities. Make no mistake: younger bro wasn't forced into anything, and he already has a separate sugar daddy supplying him with all the things a growing boy needs (a private flat on Wilshire; a fake ID good enough to fool a CHP officer; and the clicker for Daddy's Ferrari-filled garage), but 16's still 16. Now older bro's just waiting for the right time to use it...</p>

<p>Who the fuck gave this woman her own damn show?

I'm on the East Coast but grew up in the Deep South. So little of what she does is "southern cooking".

Has anyone else seen this mess? She stands there and attempts to be clever, opening up can after can after can. Using store bought packs of shredded cheese on everything.

She's not cooking a bit, not at all. She's basically putting together common white trash recipes that most of our aunts and grandmothers post on FaceBook. Shit like "better than sex cake" and such. Lots of cans of olives and tubs of cream cheese are used. She doesn't know how to chop and leaves on her gigantic mega-carot diamond ring. 

She was actually frying something up in olive oil this weekend. I'm not cook but even I know you can't/shouldn't use olive oil to fry or even brown. It burns too fast and become carcinogenic after it tops a certain temperature.

Did she get this show solely based on her money and name? She couldn't have gotten it based on her cooking.

<p>Terrific/depressing article from this month's Atlantic on ISIS:

[bold]The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it.

By Graeme Wood[/bold]

What is the Islamic State?

Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. 

[quote]“We have not defeated the idea,” he said. [bold]“We do not even understand the idea.” [/bold]

In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

The group seized Mosul, Iraq, last June, and already rules an area larger than the United Kingdom. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been its leader since May 2010, but until last summer, his most recent known appearance on film was a grainy mug shot from a stay in U.S. captivity at Camp Bucca during the occupation of Iraq. Then, on July 5 of last year, he stepped into the pulpit of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, to deliver a Ramadan sermon as the first caliph in generations—upgrading his resolution from grainy to high-definition, and his position from hunted guerrilla to commander of all Muslims. The inflow of jihadists that followed, from around the world, was unprecedented in its pace and volume, and is continuing.

Our ignorance of the Islamic State is in some ways understandable: It is a hermit kingdom; few have gone there and returned. Baghdadi has spoken on camera only once. But his address, and the Islamic State’s countless other propaganda videos and encyclicals, are online, and the caliphate’s supporters have toiled mightily to make their project knowable. We can gather that their state rejects peace as a matter of principle; that it hungers for genocide; that its religious views make it constitutionally incapable of certain types of change, even if that change might ensure its survival; and that it considers itself a harbinger of—and headline player in—the imminent end of the world.

The Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), follows a distinctive variety of Islam whose beliefs about the path to the Day of Judgment matter to its strategy, and can help the West know its enemy and predict its behavior. Its rise to power is less like the triumph of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (a group whose leaders the Islamic State considers apostates) than like the realization of a dystopian alternate reality in which David Koresh or Jim Jones survived to wield absolute power over not just a few hundred people, but some 8 million.

We have misunderstood the nature of the Islamic State in at least two ways. First, we tend to see jihadism as monolithic, and to apply the logic of al‑Qaeda to an organization that has decisively eclipsed it. The Islamic State supporters I spoke with still refer to Osama bin Laden as “Sheikh Osama,” a title of honor. But jihadism has evolved since al-Qaeda’s heyday, from about 1998 to 2003, and many jihadists disdain the group’s priorities and current leadership.

Bin Laden viewed his terrorism as a prologue to a caliphate he did not expect to see in his lifetime. His organization was flexible, operating as a geographically diffuse network of autonomous cells. The Islamic State, by contrast, requires territory to remain legitimate, and a top-down structure to rule it. (Its bureaucracy is divided into civil and military arms, and its territory into provinces.)</p>

Actress Jane Russell, who became a star with the 1943 release of "The Outlaw," Howard Hughes' challenge to the Hollywood production code, has died. She was 89.

Russell went on to play Calamity Jane opposite Bob Hope in "The Paleface" (1948), and she starred with Marilyn Monroe in the 1953 musical "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."

As former Times staff writer Claudia Luther explains in her obituary of the actress, "Russell's provocative performance in 'The Outlaw' %E2%80%94 and the studio publicity shots posing her in a low-cut blouse reclined on a stack of hay bales %E2%80%94 marked a turning point in moviedom sexuality. She became a bona fide star and a favorite pinup girl of soldiers during World War II. Troops in Korea named two embattled hills in her honor. ...

"Meanwhile, Hughes brilliantly publicized the film, issuing Russell-in-the-haystack posters with such lines as 'How Would You Like to Tussle With Russell?' and 'Mean! Moody! Magnificent!' In one publicity stunt, askywriter wrote 'The Outlaw' in the sky and then carefully drew two circles with a dot in the center of each."

Some readers will remember Russell as a pitchwoman for Playtex bras, for "full-figured women."

Services are set for 11 a.m. March 12 at Pacific Christian Church, 3435 Santa Maria Way, Santa Maria.

Instead of flowers, her family suggests donations in her name to Care Net Pregnancy & Resource Center, 121 W. Battles, Santa Maria, CA  93458; or CASA of Santa Barbara County, 120 E. Jones Street, Ste. 130, Santa Maria, CA  93454.

The full obituary of Jane Russell will follow at www.latimes.com/obits.

<p>Does anyone here remember her?

I recently saw a documentary she made, in 1968, on the BBC archive site and it/she intrigued me somewhat.

She was Nancy in the original stage production of Oliver in 1960, but it seems she was 'regrettably' overlooked for the role in the movie.

I also recognised her from her role in Upstairs Downstairs.

Here's a clip from the documentary.</p>

<p> newly discovered strain of HIV is spreading across West Africa. What's worse is that it's particularly aggressive—and causes significantly faster progression to AIDS than other strains.

Called A3/02, the strain of HIV was first observed in 2011. But now, reports Al Jazeera, researchers at Sweden's Lund University have found that it's spreading across the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. A3/02 forms when two of the most common strains in the region fuse together—and the result is potent. Angelica Palm, one of the scientists involved in the study, explains:


[quote]"Individuals who are infected with the new recombinant form develop AIDS within five years. That's about two to two-and-a-half years faster than one of the parent [strains]."

The research backs up previous studies which have suggested that recombinant strains of HIV—where different DNA combines to form a new strain—are potentially more dangerous. Perhaps even more concerning is that the researchers point out that, while their work is conducted in West Africa, different recombinant strains are likely forming across Europe and the US due to high levels of immigration. Gulp.</p>

<p>This is getting serious. 

While most of the country is obsessing over Miley Cyrus, the Obama administration is preparing a military attack against Syria which has the potential of starting World War 3.  In fact, it is being reported that cruise missile strikes could begin "as early as Thursday".  The Obama administration is pledging that the strikes will be "limited", but what happens when the Syrians fight back?  What happens if they sink a U.S. naval vessel or they have agents start hitting targets inside the United States?  Then we would have a full-blown war on our hands. 

And what happens if the Syrians decide to retaliate by hitting Israel?  If Syrian missiles start raining down on Tel Aviv, Israel will be extremely tempted to absolutely flatten Damascus, and they are more than capable of doing precisely that.  And of course Hezbollah and Iran are not likely to just sit idly by as their close ally Syria is battered into oblivion.  We are looking at a scenario where the entire Middle East could be set aflame, and that might only be just the beginning.  Russia and China are sternly warning the U.S. government not to get involved in Syria, and by starting a war with Syria we will do an extraordinary amount of damage to our relationships with those two global superpowers. 

Could this be the beginning of a chain of events that could eventually lead to a massive global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United States on the other?  Of course it will not happen immediately, but I fear that what is happening now is setting the stage for some really bad things.</p>

</a></strong>
<p>My heart bleeds for her.

From NY Daily News:

With a DUI on her record, actress Jaime Pressly isn't smiling about how her mug shot has hurt her career.

After her hearing on Friday, her lawyer, Rich Hutton, told People.com that the 33-year-old actress is "concerned about how the arrest will affect her image because she feels this situation is unjustified. It doesn't represent who she is."

But that doesn't mean Pressly doesn't accept responsibility, he said.

"She takes this [DUI case] very seriously," Hutton told the website. "She's upset, but overall %E2%80%93 aside from this %E2%80%93 she's doing very well."

Pressly was stopped by police in California in January and blew a .22 on a breathalyzer %E2%80%93 nearly three times the legal limit %E2%80%93 TMZ.com reported. The arrest came shortly before she announced she was divorcing her husband of two years, Simran Singh.

"These are all isolated incidents," she told Extra in February.

"I have no problem saying that I'm responsible for my actions. I don't blame anybody else," she added. "I'm also human and never claimed to be perfect.

Pressly is due back in court in May.</p>

<p>Parent-led child prostitution ring arrested in Bordeaux

Regional daily Sud-Ouest reported that the parent-led ring is the largest child prostitution network ever in France.

The suspects - five women and four men are all Bulgarian nationals and ethnic Roma. The children, boys aged between 12 and 16, have since been taken into custody and a special judge dealing with child protection will preside over the case.

“The children are not aware that they are victims, they are protecting their parents,” Bordeaux state prosecuter Agnès Auboin told the Sud-Ouest newspaper.

If found guilty three of the parents could face up to 15 years in prison for forcing children under 12 into prostitution as well as a three million euro fine. As the other parents’ children were aged 15 and 16 they face a lesser sentence of up to ten years and a 1.5 million euro fine.

The arrest comes following the result of an investigation into 20 boys being forced into prostitution in the city in December.

According to police commissioner Alexandre Desporte the “network was spreading” and many “clients from outside Bordeaux” were coming to area where the boys were sellling sex.</p>

<p>This past decade, we’ve witnessed quite a few advancements for gay rights in the US: anti-homophobic hate crimes legislation, the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and nationwide marriage equality, to name a few.

Liberal media often paints these stories as victories — in which the “LGBT community” has won some rights and therefore the violence and stigma against our communities has lessened.

These are supposed to be moments in history that we — those of us who are queer and trans and allies — are supposed to be celebrating.

But behind every rainbow flag, there’s a pot of Goldman Sachs (and a conservative agenda).

Rather than victories, several moments in recent history of the gay movement have been huge losses.

The gay rights movement has won rights and recognition that largely serve the interests of white, wealthy cisgender gay men to the detriment of poor queers and queer people of color, and to the detriment of racial and economic justice more generally.

Again, these are victories for the only most enfranchised gay people. Thus, they are mechanisms for perpetuating injustice.

Major LGBT organizations have claimed for a long time that we’ll start with marriage and then get to everything else, that we need visibility to achieve wider rights.

That trickledown logic is both a lie and a distraction.

Incorporating queer people into institutions like marriage and the military does not decrease queerphobic violence. It does nothing to address root causes of poverty and violence: racial, economic, and gender injustice.

Gay, Inc actually relies on violence against poor people and people of color.

In point of fact: Two of the top three drone manufacturers lobbying in DC are also major corporate donors to the Human Rights Campaign, the largest and most visible gay rights organization. The government and big gay nonprofits can claim to be doing progressive work while actually stripping people, especially people of color, of civil rights, and failing to provide basic needs like affordable housing and healthcare.

“Equality” is not liberation.

So let’s examine a few of these recent gay victories, and how they fail to advance community-wide liberation. We’ll look at the particular institutions those victories are buying into and how each actually contributes to increases in violence and discrimination. These are not progressive policies; they are actively violent.

1. Hate Crimes Legislation

The Matthew Shephard Act, passed in 2009 by President Obama, expanded hate crimes law to protect survivors of homophobic and transphobic violence. It was tacked onto the national military budget bill that year.

In other words, defense spending was increased, and we got a gay hate crimes legislation bill.

The equation is simple: United States legislation = increases in gay rights + increases in militarism.

The Matthew Shephard Act is harmful for two major reasons: First, it uses the name and experience of a white cisgender man to exemplify queerphobic hate violence, whereas 89% of folks killed in LGBT hate violence are people of color, and three-in-four are transgender women.

The brunt of this violence, then, is not directed at white cis men, but at folks who are further marginalized within the LGBT community.

Shifting attention to “gay” as a singular identity, rather than the multiple oppressions that most survivors of hate violence carry distracts from the intersectionalities of race, gender, and sexual oppression.

Campaigns that center white men as the main targets of anti-LGBT violence are missing the point. More than that, they’re wrong.

Second, the Shephard Act puts more folks in prison.

The prison system is not a place where justice happens; it’s the opposite.

The prison system is how the United States continues to dispose of poor people and people of color. 41% of Black and Latina trans women report being incarcerated, more than 13 times the national average. Queer and trans people are also far more likely to be raped in prisons and detention centers, as well as face violence at the hands of police.

Handing more power to the police and prison systems will not make our communities safer, but actually make them more susceptible to sexual violence and criminalization.

Hate crimes legislation ends up hurting even the people it’s professing to protect.

2. The Repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell

In 2010, the United States Congress repealed the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (DADT) clause, which had originally taken effect under President Clinton in 1994.

Under DADT, lesbian, gay, and bisexual military personnel were told to remain closeted to continue their service legally. DADT’s repeal meant that those service members were allowed to serve openly.

But the major issue with the US military is not its gay-friendliness.

The US defense machine swallows almost two-thirds of tax dollars (while public services are continuously cut) and disproportionately recruits poor people of color in the US to wage war on poor people of color across the world.

This pattern hasn’t ended with the inclusion of LGB people. Machine guns and drones don’t stop targeting civilians because they happen to be queer.

Further, women of color are, compared to white women, vastly overrepresented in military ranks. A study by the Pentagon estimates sexual assault rates in the armed forces occur at the rate of 70 incidents per day. The repeal of DADT had no impact on the military’s daily assault on racial and gender justice; it just gave out brownie points to an otherwise oppressive institution.

As I mentioned before, national gay rights organizing relies on funding from major drone manufacturers, in addition to oil companies and major banks, all of which profit from higher rates of war.

The Gay Agenda™ doesn’t exist outside of the US war machine, but totally within it.

3. Marriage Equality

It’s no accident that the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) came just a day after the repeal of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). The latter was passed in 1965 to outlaw racial discrimination in voting and repealed in 2013 along with DOMA.

The Supreme Court made it clear: Gay rights are in, and race still isn’t.

Besides its literal juxtaposition to the curtailing of racial justice, however, marriage equality is a very conservative demand.

Dean Spade and Craig Willsie bring together important histories of marriage in the US in their piece ”Marriage Will Never Set Us Free”’ to help us understand how marriage equality upholds existing power structures, instead of challenging them.

Marriage was originally constructed to transfer property ownership across generations (especially for white people). Maintaining that married families are superior to other formations, like single parent households, has been key to demonizing low-income black people.

President Clinton, for example, made huge cuts in welfare programs in 1996 on the grounds that unmarried parents generate poverty. Marriage has also been a strategy of control and assimilation for indigenous people and people of color both in the US and abroad.

Same-sex marriage is not going to magically change the institution of marriage. It instead allows property ownership and resources (including 1,138 federal benefits) to be moved across both gay and straight couples.

An emphasis on marriage over general rights acquisition also narrows our approach to social justice.

As Spade and Willsie point out, while a liberatory approach to healthcare would involve—well—giving healthcare to everyone, a marriage equality approach to health care involves keeping access attached to married couples only. As in, those who already have health insurance are able to share it with partners, but folks who don’t are still out of luck.

The same becomes true for citizenship and immigration status, tax benefits, and so on. People shouldn’t have to be married to access basic rights.

Marriage equality may be a victory for gay rights, but it’s also a victory for the historically oppressive institution of marriage.

***

Including gay people in marriage and the military and using gay rights to strengthen the prison system will not destroy homophobia. These are each institutions that perpetuate and rely on gender and sexual violence.

If your goal is to be in solidarity with queer and trans people, equal signs are not the way to go. Narrow agendas that rely on incorporation and assimilation into those systems create more violence for our communities, not less.

Rather, to support the lives of multiply marginalized LGBTQIA+ folks, we should focus on supporting grassroots anti-violence and anti-criminalization efforts, as well as dismantling (not reforming) prisons, marriage, and the military.

What we should be celebrating (and supporting) doesn’t tend to come in the form of national military or marriage policy. It is everyday resilience, resistance, and struggle.</p>

<p>Says Group Poses ‘Grave Threat’ to U.S.

WASHINGTON-President Barack Obama has sent Congress a draft proposal for a war resolution against Islamic State, asking for “limited” use of American force against the militant group operating in Syria and Iraq.

The resolution argues that Islamic State poses a “grave threat” to the U.S. and its Middle Eastern allies and declares the group a terrorist organization. The resolution also condemns Islamic State for “despicable acts of violence and mass execution.”

The war resolution also cites the death of four American citizens—blaming Islamic State for the deaths of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller while in captivity.

Messrs. Foley, Sotloff and Kassig were all executed on video by the group, while Ms. Mueller’s death was confirmed by U.S. officials this week.

The new resolution would repeal the 2002 law that authorized President George W. Bush to invade Iraq and replace it with a three-year war authorization allowing the U.S. to use military force against Islamic State.

The draft resolution now goes to Congress, where it will be considered by the Republican-controlled House and Senate.</p>

<p>I'm listening to Carly Simon's 1981 album Torch, and I'm struck by how much I like it now - as much as I did when I first heard it. This was my first serious introduction to American standards and torch songs. The record got panned on release and still isn't very well regarded, but I think she has a great feel for the songs. Moreover, she was rather adventurous in her choices, including some old tunes that I hadn't heard before and haven't heard since. Her voice is technically quite imperfect, yet her sentiment to me is spot on. And I even think the occasional synthesizer sound is well integrated into the arrangements.

I did like Ronstadt's What's New, which served as my intro to Nelson Riddle, but I don't think she has the same sense for the sorrow that Simon did.

Later I discovered an earlier record by Harry Nilsson, A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, which I find fantastic. He has a beautiful falsetto and really knows how to convey the loneliness, despondence, and adoration of the lyrics.

Other suggestions?</p>

<p>Clash of the Titans" opens to $108 million worldwide

 LOS ANGELES, April 4 (Reuters) - "Clash of the Titans," the latest film to cash in on the 3D craze, easily won the battle at the worldwide box office during the weekend, according to studio estimates issued on Sunday.

The Olympian epic earned $64.1 million from theaters in the United States and Canada since opening Thursday evening, said Time Warner Inc (TWX.N)-owned distributor Warner Bros Pictures.

The opening was in line with industry expectations, and the $61.4 million portion from the traditional Friday-to-Sunday period sets a new record for an Easter release. The previous Easter record was set by "Scary Movie 4" ($40.2 million) in 2006.

The film, starring Sam Worthington ("Avatar") as the heroic Perseus and Ralph Fiennes as the villainous Hades, also grossed $44.2 million from No. 1 openings in all 15 of its foreign markets. Spain contributed $8.6 million in five days, Britain $7.8 million in three, and South Korea $6.8 million in four. The early worldwide total stands at $108.26 million.

Worldwide, 3D screenings accounted for just over half of total sales even though the film played in more 2D locations.

Since the success of "Avatar," Hollywood has rushed to capitalize on 3D movies because studios can charge higher ticket prices for the experience. "Clash of the Titans," which cost over $100 million to make, is not even a true 3D film since it was converted from 2D after filming was completed.

But movie theater owners have been slow to equip their theaters with new technology, creating a logjam among 3D titles. "Clash" competed for playdates with previous champion "How to Train Your Dragon" and recent leader "Alice in Wonderland."

DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc's (DWA.O) "Dragon" slipped to No. 3 with $29.2 million, taking its 10-day haul to $92.3 million. After a relatively disappointing $44 million opening that sent the studio's stock price down eight percent on Monday, the film lost just one-third of its audience. Second-weekend drops tend to be in the 50 percent range.

Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) "Alice" fell three to No. 5 with $8.3 million in its fifth weekend; its tally stands at $309.8 million.

Among other openers, Tyler Perry's "Why Did I Get Married Too?" came in at No. 2 with $30.2 million, the second-highest opening for the prolific filmmaker after "Madea Goes to Jail" ($41 million) last year. Perry's low-cost films are released by Lionsgate, a unit of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGF.N).

The Disney drama "The Last Song," teen starlet Miley Cyrus' first foray into mature fare, debuted at No. 4 with $16.2 million. Its total stands at a solid $25.6 million after opening on Wednesday.</p>

Say this for Vince McMahon, the head of WWE: the man is growing old fiercely.

McMahon appears on the cover of the March issue of Muscle & Fitness looking like ... well, looking like something's living in the skin underneath his arms and chest, honestly, but also like he'll rip your little head off for challenging him. Airbrushing? Photo trickery? Perhaps, but McMahon's clearly done a decent job of keeping himself in shape by any standard.

--
I want to share the experience that my husband, 7 year old autistic sister and I had today at the Chili’s location in Midvale, UT. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. Lauren smiled and told Arianna, “Okay! I’ll be right back with your chocolate milk!”. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! So this behavior was VERY strange. So I asked her, “Why don’t you want it?”. She replied, “It’s broken. I need another one thats fixed.” Then it dawned on me why she wasn’t eating it. It’s because it was cut in half. Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.

When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. She had a concerned look on her face so I explained that Arianna has autism, and that in her mind, because the cheeseburger was cut in half, she thinks its broken and can’t eat it. I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out.

Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, “I heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger! I am so sorry about that! We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. Arianna said, “OH FANK YOU! You fixded my cheeseburger!” When Lauren walked away, Arianna just sat there for a second and looked at her new burger. She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. She came back a minute later and said she showed everyone in the back kitchen area too, and that it made them all laugh and smile. I was so touched by this experience. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive.</p>

<p>Micke Ekvall finished the race in 21st place. In a post-race interview, a reporter asked him, "Did you ever consider stopping to clean off?"

"No, I'd lose time," he explained, "If you quit once, it's easy to do it again and again and again. It becomes a habit."

"Despite the enormous problems with stomach cramps that lasted between two and 12 kilometers, Micke completed his goal," Swedish site Jesper.nu reported, "He did fine with [a time of] 1:09:43 and came in a creditable 21st. This is despite the misery! Imagine what he could accomplish without a bad stomach."

The poop man, now 25 years old, has accomplished quite a bit since then. He ran the same race the following year, placing 9th. He went on to set a Swedish national record at the Copenhagen half-marathon in 2014, and represented Sweden at the European Athletic Championships.

Ekvall's story is truly an inspirational one: Never quit. If you can live down running around in public with your own feces streaming off your bare legs, you can live down practically anything. Either that or never, ever, leave the house, because anything you do could go horribly wrong and everyone is looking at you.

Whatever. It's up to each of us to receive the poop man's wisdom in our own way.</p>

<p>Every Sunday, come rain or shine I like to make American pancakes for breakfast...it's one of the things I used to miss most about America.

In fact I learnt(ed) how to make them properly from DLers...maybe five or six years ago and they're pretty good now, even if I say so myself. Today we had buckwheat.

But, funny thing happened. Last week I was in Chiswick (don't ask me why) and wandered into an American shop...where I came across Pure VERMONT Maple Syrup, so I swallowed hard (and ignored the hefty price) and decided to buy some and it's much nicer than the (also v. pricey) Canadian stuff I've been buying all this time.

Which has made me think twice, quite frankly, about what I'll buy in future.

So, I thought to ask the folks on DL which maple syrup they'd most recommend ( I'll also post a pic of the AMERICAN maple syrup that so pleased me so much this morning).</p>

<p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The winds of political change are coursing through austerity-weary Greece, but a financial whirlwind may lurk round the corner.

Opinion polls ahead of Sunday's closely-watched national election agree: The radical left opposition Syriza party, which has vowed to rewrite the terms of Greece's international bailout, is poised to defeat Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservatives. To govern — in a historic first for the Greek left — it may need the backing of a smaller party, but most seem willing to oblige.

"I want this government to go. It has disappointed me," said Babis Limnaios, 41, an Athens electrician who last voted in 2004 for the conservatives but will now back Syriza. "I want them to change everything — tax, health care, education."

Communist-rooted Syriza has alarmed markets and investors with its talk of massive debt forgiveness and riding roughshod over the bailout deals. But the mood is less fraught than in the last national election in 2012, when many saw a Syriza victory as a precursor to a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, the 19 nations that now share the euro currency.

For one, Greece's European partners are less exposed to fallout from a Greek financial collapse. The eurozone has a bailout fund and the European Central Bank has committed to buy the bonds of troubled countries, if needed. And despite erratic bombshells from some Syrizan officials — one candidate suggested printing euros if push comes to shove — the party is straining to play up its mainstream, Eurocentric aspects.

Still, Greece's next government faces an enormous to-do list. It must consolidate reforms, keep running balanced budgets, strengthen weak growth after a six-year recession, conclude frozen talks with bailout inspectors to secure a 7.2-billion-euro ($8.1 billion) loan tranche and negotiate further relief for its bloated, 320-billion-euro ($359 billion) debt.

Creditors insist Athens must honor its bailout commitments if it is to receive continued support. If things go wrong, Greece could again face default — despite its 240-billion-euro ($269 billion) bailout and years of belt-tightening — and find its eurozone membership untenable.

Samaras, whose New Democracy party governed since May 2012 in a coalition with its Socialist former archrivals, has promised some tax relief, saying economic growth and investment will gradually reduce unemployment. He was forced to call Sunday's vote to end an impasse over the election of Greece's new president.

Syriza's 40-year-old leader, Alexis Tsipras — a former Communist youth member — favors a radical approach: Writing off most of Greece's debt, a burden he describes as "not just unbearable, it objectively cannot be repaid."

Tsipras voiced confidence Friday that he can strike a "viable, mutually acceptable and beneficial" deal with creditors by the end of June, after which Greece will need to pay maturing bonds worth more than 10 billion euros that are held by the ECB.

Syriza wants to ditch primary surplus targets, while still pursuing a balance between non-debt-related spending and revenues. It proposes to restore the minimum monthly salary from 586 to 751 euros ($657 to $842), provide free power and food coupons to 300,000 households, raise the tax-free income threshold from 5,000 to 12,000 euros ($13,500), reverse public sector firings and liberalize labor laws.

Greece's electoral system gives a 50-seat boost to the first party, making it effectively impossible for the runner-up to form a coalition if the winner fails.

In a deeply polarized campaign, the conservatives have demonized Syriza, stoking middle class fears of bankruptcy and a return to the old drachma currency.

"The only thing they haven't said so far is that, if Syriza wins, it will round up your children and seize your women," Tsipras joked.

But the invective doesn't seem to be working.

Opinion polls published on the last day of campaigning showed Syriza increasing its lead, with five surveys giving Tsipras an advantage of between 5.2 and 6.7 percentage points — a gain of about 2 points in a week.

In the name of national salvation, Greeks have suffered five years of gruesomely high unemployment, during which the economy shrank by a quarter and average incomes by a third. Jobs, where available, are mostly underpaid or part-time, offering no social security or prospects for advancement. Health care services have deteriorated, pensions have been slashed, and most apartment blocks lack central heating because so many residents can't pay.

Meanwhile, the average tax burden has multiplied.

The final straw was last year's decision to make permanent a hated new property tax. That hurts, because for decades ordinary Greeks had invested in real estate. Since 2009, however, market prices — but not taxable values — have dropped 40 percent and rents have shrunk.

Cinema production electrician Gerasimos Soulis said he would vote for Syriza but without great conviction in its ability to enact change.

"Jobs have opened, but they're not jobs. It's like you're making pocket money," he said. "We are trying with a third of the money to do what we used to do. And we're happy that we now have a third, because they made us grow accustomed to having nothing."

What remains doubtful is whether Syriza will secure the minimum 151 seats in Greece's 300-member parliament that it needs to govern alone. If not, it must look for a partner from a smaller party.

Tsipras said Friday that he is "one step" away from an absolute majority, which would spare him an alliance with "the forces of yesterday, which have every reason to want to trip Syriza up after the election." But he indicated that he would compromise, if needed, to avoid a second election a month later.

With the politically untouchable, Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party, whose leadership is in jail awaiting trial for running a criminal organization, and the Communist Party — which refuses to cooperate with anyone — out of the picture, possible partners include the new, centrist but untried Potami (River) party or the once-formidable PASOK Socialists.

Friday's polls suggested Golden Dawn has made late gains and is challenging Potami for third place.

A third option for Syriza could be governing with the populist right-wing Independent Greeks, who agree with Syriza on need to end the austerity but disagree on about everything else.</p>

<li><strong><a href="/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=14887074">The New Greece</a></strong>
<p>A great many narratives invoking Greece are being tossed around, but only one really encapsulates the unvarnished truth: the Oligarchs blew it. The oligarchs in both Greece and the European Union/ECB had the opportunity a few years ago to trade some of their outsized wealth and political power for stability and sustainable expansion.
 
Instead, they chose to not just cling to every shred of their outsized wealth and power but to actively increase it. Their greed and hubris has now put their entire system of parasitic wealth extraction at risk of collapse. Their political stranglehold on power has been weakened, and there's no going back: they blew it, and now it's too late. The debt-serfs have finally had enough.
 
If you enter Greece in the custom search box on this site, six pages of blog entries come up. I have addressed the situation in Greece many times; this summarizes my conclusion:
 
Greece, Please Do The Right Thing: Default Now (June 1, 2011)
 
Thankfully, many in Greece have reached the same conclusion, for the same reasons:
 
Greece's New FinMin Warns "We Are Going To Destroy The Greek Oligarchy System"
 
The basic problem is that Greece Is a Kleptocracy (June 28, 2011). Greece has shown the world how oligarchies can expand their wealth and power even as their populace slides deeper into poverty. A recent article, Misrule of the Few: How the Oligarchs Ruined Greece, lays out the key dynamics.
 
Writer Pavlos Eleftheriadis pulls no punches:
"Greece has failed to address (rising wealth/income inequality) because the country’s elites have a vested interest in keeping things as they are. Since the early 1990s, a handful of wealthy families -- an oligarchy in all but name -- has dominated Greek politics. These elites have preserved their positions through control of the media and through old-fashioned favoritism, sharing the spoils of power with the country’s politicians. Greek legislators, in turn, have held on to power by rewarding a small number of professional associations and public-sector unions that support the status quo. Even as European lenders have put the country’s finances under a microscope, this arrangement has held."
The vested interests have obscured the cold reality of rising inequality by focusing obsessively on "growth" as the fix-all to inequality.
 
But this is exactly backward. As Eleftheriadis observes:
"The fundamental problem facing Greece is not slow economic growth but political inequality. To the benefit of a favored few, cumbersome regulations and dysfunctional institutions remain largely unchanged, even as the country’s infrastructure crumbles, poverty increases, and corruption persists. Greek society also faces new dangers. Overall unemployment stands at 27 percent, and youth unemployment exceeds 50 percent, providing an ideal recruiting ground for extremist groups on both the left and the right. Meanwhile, the oligarchs are still profiting at the expense of the country -- and the rest of Europe."
All the blather about "growth" is just propaganda to misdirect our attention from the real problem: the total domination of governance and finance by a class of vested interests and mega-wealthy cartels/oligarchies.
 
The solution is straightforward: default on all debt by no longer making interest payments. There is no way Greece can pay back the $240 billion of current debt, and sooner the delusion that this can be renegotiated to preserve the oligarchy is smashed, the better.
 
As for the big threat of kicking Greece out of the euro currency--since most Greeks are already impoverished, how can they get any poorer? The reality is poor countries prosper by making their goods and services cheaper via currency devaluations, and by paying a healthy rate of interest on capital so capital is attracted and invested productively, as high interest rates make speculative, marginal gambles soberingly risky.
 
The only people with enough wealth left to worry about a return to a sovereign currency are the wealthy who own the assets and who depend on handouts from the E.U.
 
As the old saying has it, you can't get blood from a turnip. The impoverished face little downside from leaving the stranglehold of the euro, and only upside from a return to a sovereign currency controlled by the Greeks rather than the E.U. or the European Central Bank (ECB).
 
The threat of expelling Greece from the euro is hollow. A return to a sovereign currency puts the responsibility for prudent management of government expenditures and debt back in the hands of the Greek people and the leaders they elect. Why is that something terrible?
 
If the new leadership of Greece pursues policies of fiscal prudence, high interest rates, zero-tolerance for corruption and freeing up the Greek economy to encourage small-scale enterprise, any decline in Greece's sovereign currency will be brief. If they pursue meet the new boss, same as the old boss policies, then the Greek people will remain shackled in poverty.
 
We have to remember that the lenders who entrusted capital to marginal borrowers took the risk and therefore have to absorb the losses. In this case, the irresponsible lenders include sovereign nations that acted to protect their own oligarchies.
 
Why? Once one oligarchy falls, it will threaten to topple a long line of oligarch dominoes.</p>

<p>The Facts of Life star says that Christians have earned the antigay stigma "with good reason," and it's unfortunate because that's "not at all what Jesus taught."

Actress Lisa Whelchel is famous for many things. Her nine season run as Blair on The Facts of Life. Her recent stint on Survivor. And for being a devout Christian.

It’s that last label that has garnered the actress some negative press over the years, particularly among gay and lesbian fans who remember her fondly and the blonde haired socialite who shared barbs — and many would argue sexual tension — with motorcycle driving Jo (Nancy McKeon) on the NBC sitcom.

But Whelchel dispelled many of those rumors that she’s antigay in recent interview for The Justin Root Show. In the 22 minute interview, Whelchel spoke honestly about her religion and antigay Christians – an “unfortunate” stigma they’ve earned “with good reason,” she says.

“There are some very loud voices that wear the ‘one way Jesus’ t-shirts and point fingers,” Whelchel said in the interview. “Sadly, that is the voice and that is the poster child for christianity and the unacceptance of people that choose differently.”

Interesting word choice – choose  - which Whelchel realizes immediately, correcting herself.

“Born differently, cuz’ even that you have to be careful with, saying choose differently. That’s an electric rod right there. I’m sorry about that, and I’m sad for that… because that is, of course, not at all what Jesus taught. (Jesus) taught acceptance and love and grace. I’m sad that (being antigay) is the stigma that Christians have deserved, unfortunately.”

As to her career, Whelchel says she’s worked with LGBT’s whom she has cared about dearly for her entire career.

“My friends have been a variety of sexual orientations since I was little,” she says.

Scientology Doc ‘Going Clear’ Claims the Church Split Up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman

Alex Gibney’s highly anticipated documentary Going Clear, which premiered at Sundance, makes some shocking claims about Scientology A-lister Tom Cruise.

Alex Gibney’s Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is arguably the most hotly anticipated film premiering at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.

HBO Documentary Films, which is releasing the eye-opening documentary on the Church of Scientology later this year, hired a team of 160 lawyers to look over the movie, and the church, despite not having seen it, took out a recent ad in The New York Times accusing Gibney’s film of being “a Rolling Stone/UVA redux.”

I just attended the first screening of Going Clear, which is based on the book of the same name by Lawrence Wright, and can report that it is a scathing exposé on Scientology and makes some startling accusations about its most famous member, Tom Cruise.

The film alleges that the Church of Scientology used a number of intimidation tactics to force Cruise to split from Nicole Kidman.

According to the testimony of Marty Rathbun, formerly the second-highest ranking official in the Church of Scientology who left in 2004, Scientology head David Miscavige was suspicious of Cruise’s second wife, whose father was a renowned psychologist in his native Australia. Scientology is vehemently opposed to psychiatry and psychology, and Rathbun claims that because of Kidman’s father, she was labeled a “Potential Trouble Source” (PTS), defined by the Church of Scientology as “a person who is in some way connected to and being adversely affected by a suppressive person.”

Gibney’s film claims that Kidman, who was raised Catholic, convinced Cruise to distance himself from the Church of Scientology between 1992 and 2001, and that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn’t returning Miscavige’s phone calls, though Miscavige was one of Cruise’s best pals and served as best man in his wedding to Kidman. Cruise’s silence allegedly infuriated Miscavige, who then assigned Rathbun to the A-list couple.

“I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman,” Rathbun says in the film.

Rathbun alleges in the film that the Church of Scientology then waged an aggressive campaign to get Cruise to dump Kidman, including having a private investigator wiretap her phone—at Cruise’s apparent suggestion, according to Rathbun—and sending the tapes to Miscavige. The Church of Scientology also began “auditing” Cruise around the clock, according to the film, aggressively psychoanalyzing him and gathering personal information. The information was then allegedly sent to Miscavige, whom Rathbun claims blasted Cruise for his “perverted” sexual fetishes.

Furthermore, Rathbun says the Church of Scientology “re-educated” Cruise’s adopted children with Kidman, Connor and Isabella, into turning against their mother so that Cruise could retain custody.

Cruise divorced Kidman in 2001 and following the split became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church’s Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004 and becoming Scientology’s de facto Hollywood spokesman.

Going Clear also claims that the Church of Scientology takes great pains to accommodate Cruise, including installing all the audiovisual equipment in his home, purchasing him limousines and airplanes, and once even having its members design a meadow for Cruise and Kidman to run through—an alleged fantasy of Cruise’s.

Cruise and Kidman, the film notes in a card before the film’s final credits, both refused to be interviewed for Gibney’s movie.</p>

<p>Two months ago someone new joined our department. She wears very strong perfume. It is an extremely cloying floral scent that permeates the entire office area.  Three of us are allergic to this stuff. The scent is so overpowering it makes our eyes burn and water, although we sit on the other side of a low wall from the woman.

We have each separately asked our manager to address this issue, but he doesn't want to deal with it. He asked our other managers (who all work in a different state!) to speak to her, but they refused.  

Last week senior management finally decided to do something. The VP sent an email to our entire team, regarding office etiquette and the use of overpowering personal fragrance. Our coworker didn't think the message applied to her, so she's still stinking up the place.

<p>Could we please not forgive Sarah Palin? She is an unrepentant nightmare

Palin’s SNL cameo might have been a joke, but her oppressive political tactics aren’t. Laughter is a powerful weapon: we should be laughing at her, not with her.

Lindy West, Tuesday 17 February 2015 11.01 EST



Conservative pundit Sarah Palin made a cute, sporting little cameo on Saturday Night Live’s 40th anniversary show this weekend – winking at her own disastrous 2008 vice-presidential run, which was memorably skewered at the time by SNL’s Tina Fey. In the bit on Sunday night, Palin piped up during a Q&A with Jerry Seinfeld to ask, “Just curious, Jerry, how much do you think [SNL producer] Lorne Michaels would pay me if I were to run in 2016 with Donald Trump as my running mate?”

“I don’t think there’s a number too big,” Seinfeld replied.

Har har. Cute! See, Fey’s Palin impression was a big hit for the show back in 2008, got marvellous ratings, and will long be remembered as a seminal SNL moment – but not, as one might think, because Sarah Palin was some wacky, harmless goofball destined to be a delightful footnote in the annals of election history. No. Nope.

No. People loved those Tina Fey/Sarah Palin sketches because Sarah Palin is a terrifying, anti-intellectual, anti-choice, gun-toting ideologue who came within a hair’s breadth of one of the most powerful political offices in the world, a dystopian potentiality that could have tangibly affected the lives of literally billions of people. Watching her being flawlessly lampooned – her hypocrisy and pomposity laid bare with a clarity that only comedy can achieve – felt like a gossamer lifeline of hope and sanity to which we could all cling.

In short: Fey’s Palin impression wasn’t important because Palin is trivial and amusing. It was important because Palin is anything but. And we need to remember that.

So please. Everyone. I am begging you. Do not participate in or encourage the aw-shucks redemption of Sarah Palin – or any other unrepentant nightmare person, for that matter. She does not deserve it. She is the same person she was in 2008 (though seemingly even more desperate and eager to pander) and she is still actively trying to make the world worse.

Here is a quick refresher on Sarah Palin’s greatest hits, for those who may have forgotten: she opposes abortion in every circumstance – even rape and incest – unless the mother’s life is in danger, in which case she concedes that an adult woman might qualify as a human being. She supported legislation to require parental consent for underage abortion in Alaska. She wrote in her book, America By Heart, that “the new feminism is telling women they are capable and strong” – her subtext being, of course, that the old feminism fosters weakness in women by empowering them to speak out against injustice (you know, like weak people do).

Palin’s entire career rests on the back of her favourite false dichotomy: “Real Americans” (rural, incurious, “traditional” voters afraid of big government and change of any kind) v fake Americans (an ill-defined amalgam of liberal elites, immigrants, abortion-hungry feminazis, people who read publications, Washington fat cats, Wall Street grifters and Katie Couric). In an interview during the 2008 election season, not only could she not cite any news sources that she reads, she was unable to name any magazine or newspaper at all.

She argued on Fox News that America should “go back to what our founders and our founding documents meant – they’re quite clear – that we would create law based on the God of the Bible and the ten commandments. It’s quite simple.” She has repeatedly implied that President Obama is a terrorist and/or “pals around” with terrorists. She compared spending on social programs to slavery (only this time, it’s middle-class white Americans who are the slaves) – and said that climate change is the new eugenics. Last month, she let her child stand on a dog.

I confess, I fell into a similar trap when it came to George W Bush’s burgeoning painting career, particularly when he left his Putin’s misshapen face period and entered his kitty cat with an attitude problem phase. There’s something so appealing about a redemption story; a good sport, a comeback, a kitty painting – maybe it feeds some Pollyanna delusion that these awful, oppressive people (and, by extension, the world) aren’t so bad after all. Unfortunately, chasing that myopic positivity lets bad people off the hook.

Yes, I know the SNL bit was just a joke, and Palin was a surprisingly good sport about it (much like shooting wolves from a helicopter, another favorite Palin pastime). And that’s not to say we can’t laugh at Sarah Palin. We should laugh at her.

She’s both absurd and sinister, and laughter is a powerful weapon. (That’s also not to say that she deserves the kind of violent, gendered harassment levelled at her by so many opponents. She doesn’t).

But Sarah Palin comes down so aggressively on the worst possible side of every issue, it’s hard to believe she isn’t just an extremely savvy, high-profile, for-profit troll. And the difference between Palin and your average rightwing internet troll, is that she manages to get herself on TV, where she can spout these ideas to millions and millions of people. When I watch Palin goofing around on SNL, I see teenage girls being denied abortions (after years of abstinence-only education, of course). I see women convincing themselves that it is somehow “capable and strong” to be a doormat for the status quo. I see gay Americans being denied access to their partners’ death beds. I see regression and grief. I have no interest in laughing with her – only at her.</p>
