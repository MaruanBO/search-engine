<p><strong></strong>Two new studies indicate that low levels of vitamin D are linked to cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses — but only one offers enthusiastic support for supplementation in pill form.</p>
<p>Both studies, published this month in the <em>British Medical Journal (BMJ)</em>, were meta-analyses of earlier research that looked at the relationship between various illnesses and vitamin D levels, as well as whether taking a daily D supplement had a positive impact on health.</p>
<p>The studies, which looked at data on more than one million people, confirmed <a href="https://experiencelife.com/article/the-vitamin-d-debate/" target="_blank">previously reported</a> evidence of the risks associated with vitamin D deficiency:</p>
<p><em>Inadequate vitamin D levels can increase your risk of dozens of serious health problems, including cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease, and even the </em><a href="http://experiencelife.com/article/flu-fears/" target="_blank"><em>common cold</em></a><em> and influenza. And apparently, nearly all of us are at risk of vitamin D deficiency …</em></p>
<p><em>“Ninety-five percent of Americans are deficient in vitamin D — that’s how big the problem is,” says John J. Cannell, MD, who heads the nonprofit Vitamin D Council. “It’s very difficult to overstate the seriousness of the situation.” —</em><a href="http://experiencelife.com/article/the-vitamin-d-debate/" target="_blank"><em>“The Vitamin D Debate”</em></a><em> (</em>Experience Life<em>, December 2011)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1903" target="_blank">One of the studies</a> found that adults with lower levels of vitamin D in their blood had a greater mortality risk; they also had a 35 percent increased risk of death from heart disease, and 14 percent increased risk of death from cancer.</p>
<p>This study also looked at <a href="http://experiencelife.com/article/new-report-questions-vitamin-d-supplementation/" target="_blank">supplementation</a>. The researchers found that middle-aged and older adults who took vitamin D3 had an 11 percent reduction in overall mortality compared to those who didn’t take the supplement. D3 is the type of vitamin D produced by the body in response to sun exposure and is also found in a few foods, such as wild salmon and shiitake mushrooms. (There was no apparent benefit to supplementing with another form of the vitamin, D2, the researchers found.)</p>

<p>When most of us were kids, the sight of cauliflower on our plates usually inspired grimaces, followed by covert attempts to pass it to the dog when mom wasn’t looking. Recently I was speaking with one of my patients who was in the midst of transitioning to a healthier diet. She mentioned that she had just re-discovered cauliflower which she’d avoided for years, but now had “fallen in love” with – which of course was music to my ears. (I love it when patients get excited about veggies!) In fact, my wife Janice and I, with our interest in health-sustaining foods, have also recently reconnected with cauliflower and are always on the look-out for tasty ways to enjoy it. Among our favorites: cauliflower rice to accompany curries and stews, and creamy cauliflower soup that’s a meal in itself. Not only are cauliflower-centric dishes delicious, but they’re nutrionally sumptuous as well. To follow are 5 reasons why I encourage you to put more cauliflower in your life  – preferably 2-to-3 servings a week – and enjoy every bite:</p>
<h3>1. Cauliflower Takes Direction Well</h3>
<p>Versatility, thy name is cauliflower! Roast it, grill it, mash it, rice it, puree it, stir-fry it.  Smother it in healthy, healing spices like curry, fennel, black pepper and turmeric, snack on it raw or serve it up old school, simply steamed. No matter how you prepare it, cauliflower is a mealtime culinary champ. Just about the only thing cauliflower doesn’t do well is dessert.</p>
<h3>2. Cauliflower is Inexpensive and Available Virtually Everywhere</h3>
<p>Whether you’re on a budget or not, cauliflower fills out your plate with lots of wonderful nutrients and fiber at a very reasonable price. The average 3 lb. head of fresh cauliflower, will set you back roughly $3 &#8211; $4, making it a pretty good deal per pound. You can also eat the leaves and stalks so there’s minimal waste to boot. Another plus: the Environmental Working Group has cauliflower on its “Clean 15” list, so it’s not imperative that you buy organic – the offerings from the local farmers’ market or supermarket will work just fine. No time to chop? Take a shortcut: many recipes work equally well using super-convenient frozen, bagged cauliflower.</p>
<h3>3. Cauliflower Brings Loads of Nutrition to the Table</h3>
<p>There are so many good things packed into a head of the often over-looked cauliflower, you might even call it a secret superfood. Just look what’s going on with this amazing cruciferous veggie which, by the way, has been linked in numerous studies to lowered cancer risk. Cauliflower’s got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients to help keep your heart and brain healthy</li>
<li>High levels of vitamin C and K, and beta-carotene to help keep immunity strong</li>
<li>Significant amounts of folate and fiber to support digestive health</li>
<li>And loads of other wonderful phytonutirents, those valuable compounds in plants that help combat disease</li>
</ul>

						<p>John Oliver does it again. This video is smart, hilarious and very important &#8212; it is a MUST watch.

<p>Redness. Acne. Wrinkles. Premature aging. Rosacea. Psoriasis. Eczema.</p>
<p>What do they all have in common?</p>
<p>Inflammation.</p>
<p>It’s a natural immune response. When you cut yourself, immune cells go to work fixing the damage. Your skin swells up (inflames) and turns red. After a few days, it heals, and everything’s fine.</p>
<p>But sometimes that healing doesn’t take place. The inflammation continues, steadily, chronically.</p>
<p>This can happen inside your body, and has been linked in studies to heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. Chronic inflammation, doctors call it, and it can affect your skin, too.</p>
<p>Acne breakouts, dermatitis, eczema, rosacea, premature aging, and other skin conditions are all inflammatory in nature, and tend to get worse when we eat an inflammatory diet.</p>
<p>The solution? Eat foods that calm inflammation and you’re more likely to enjoy clear, youthful looking skin!</p>
<h3>7 Foods that Help Calm Inflammation</h3>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><strong>Walnuts: </strong>The key here is healthy essential fatty acids. They’re good for the body and the skin. A 2004 study found that a diet high in walnuts helped lower C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a standard marker of inflammation associated with heart disease. Wild-caught salmon is another good source of these healthy fats, as are flaxseed, chia seeds, and anchovies.</li>
<li><strong>Broccoli: </strong>This is a superfood when it comes to reducing inflammation. A 2013 study found that people who ate broccoli for just 10 days cut their inflammation levels in half! A 2014 study also found that women who ate the most cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli and cauliflower) had substantially less inflammation than those who ate the fewest. Broccoli has also been found to help repair DNA damage. Broccoli sprouts have similar benefits and work great on salads.</li>
<li><strong>Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut: </strong>The key here is probiotics. You can get them from any type of fermented food, including those listed here as well as pickles, miso, kombucha tea, fermented cheese, and more. These are stars when it comes to reducing inflammation. A 2009 study, for example, found that probiotic supplementation actually helped reduce the risk and severity of dermatitis. An earlier study also found that probiotics helped reduce inflammation in the intestine. <a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/7-foods-that-calm-inflammation-and-bring-back-the-glow/#more-22842" class="more-link">Read the Whole Article</a></li>

<p>The Food Babe, Vani Hari, is a revolutionary food activist and the author of a new book called <em><a href="http://thefoodbabeway.com/" target="_blank">The Food Babe Way</a>.  </em>I sat down to interview her about her food investigations, GMO&#8217;s in processed foods, and changes to the food industry in America.</p>
<p><strong>FL. Why did you begin investigating the foods Americans consume?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vani  </strong> I began my food journey, like most people, by following the standard American diet. As a successful management consultant, I was either in the office eating whatever take-out was available, or I was on the road eating every meal out. Although this lifestyle allowed me to fit in with my peers and work crazy hours, it also took a huge toll on my body and I became very ill. Over the holiday season over ten years ago, I found myself in a hospital bed. I was sick, overweight, and I was ready to change! I made a personal promise that from that point on that I was going to make health my number one priority. FoodBabe.com was born in April 2011, from my years of learning, investigating and researching how to live a healthy lifestyle in this overly processed world. As I learned more about the habits needed for a healthy lifestyle and what dangerous ingredients to avoid, my friends and family begged me to start a blog in order to share everything I had uncovered. My first investigation was into my favorite yogurt chain. After the CEO responded to my writings by yanking some of the misleading marketing, I continued writing about the injustices and corrupt practices of the food industry. Over the past three years, FoodBabe.com has grown to have a readership of over 4 million inspired individuals who are seeking to lead heather lives and rid our food system of deadly ingredients. It is through the help of the entire Food Babe Army that the investigations and petitions on FoodBabe.com have been able to force some of the largest food corporations to change, including Kraft, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Subway, Anheuser-Busch, and Starbucks.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>FL. </strong>Why is it important for everyone to learn how to read food labels and avoid food additives? </p>
<p><strong>Vani  </strong> Many of the food additives that the FDA deems safe, have not be studied long term and no one has studied the cumulative effect of all the food additives we are eating. The Deputy Commissioner of the FDA, Michael Taylor, recently admitted to the Washington Post, <em>“We do not know the volume of particular chemicals that are going into the food supply so we can diagnose trends. We do not know what is going on post-market”</em>.  These food-like substances are made from chemicals that are cheap, provide zero nutritional value and improve the bottom line of food manufacturers. Fake foods do nothing for our health and in some cases could cause harm.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>FL. </strong>What do you find most shocking about processed food in America? </p>
<p><strong>Vani  </strong> I was floored when I discovered that several American food companies are using harmful additives that are not used — and in some cases banned — in other countries. One of those products is an iconic staple that almost every American, me included, has had at one time or another: Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. I found it hypocritical that Kraft was selling Mac &amp; Cheese overseas with natural dyes paprika and beta carotene (real food) and meanwhile, here they were selling petroleum-based food dyes (yellow #5 and yellow #6 linked to a myriad of health issues) to their fellow Americans. This double standard made me so angry, I started a petition. After receiving over 350,000 signatures and leading a strong 7 month campaign, Kraft announced that it’s starting to remove artificial food dyes from some Mac &amp; Cheese varieties marketed to children and now has started to make those changes to additional products. It’s alarming that the FDA allowing additives that are banned or restricted in other countries and linked to health risks like azodicarbonamide, BHT, BHA, and parabens. Europe has taken a precautionary principle towards several food additives and banned or labeled them for their citizens. Why isn’t the United States doing the same?</p>

<h6 style="margin-bottom: 7px; color: #3671a1;">By Be Well Health Coach Jenny Sansouci</h6>
<p dir="ltr">We’re all about healthy eating here at Be Well, but we believe in a little indulgence once in awhile, too. Unless you’re battling a condition that calls for strict adherence to a specific diet, having a bit of your grandma’s famous apple pie or a homemade treat shouldn’t be a problem on occasion. The important thing is to indulge in foods that are actually foods! It’s much healthier for your body and mind to use your “eat in moderation” tokens on things that are actually whole foods &#8212; there’s no use in indulging in processed chemicals or fake foods that are only going to weaken your health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I asked around the office to get a sense of what some of the other Be Well Health Coaches “would never touch,” no matter how indulgent the meal. Here’s a list of 5 things we don’t believe you should ever eat &#8212; even in moderation. Avoid these culprits &#8211; your body will thank you for it.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">MSG</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is an addictive food additive, used as a flavor enhancer. About 80% of processed foods contain MSG, and it’s known under 50 different names &#8212; including “yeast extract” and “modified food starch.” MSG has been known to cause tingling, numbness, brain fog, chest pain, and is strongly related to obesity — in fact, in many lab tests, they feed mice MSG to make them fat in order to do weight loss research on them.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">HFCS</h3>
<p dir="ltr">High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is linked to increased inflammation in the body, which leads to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Although some people will say “sugar is sugar,” high fructose corn syrup is an industrially produced product made by the corn industry, and you won’t find it in any real foods. If you’ll notice, high fructose corn syrup is only found in very low quality processed foods that are providing no nutritional value to your life anyway. Find me a high quality food that has HFCS in it!</p>

<p>It’s the dawn of a new year, the time of beginnings, the clean slate, and a fresh start. After all the seasonal excesses, now’s a great time to start or re-start your wellness journey. For many people the first question is, where to begin? In my practice, we answer that question – and hundreds more – every day with the help of the Be Well health coaches, our in-house team of wellness pros who support, guide, educate and advise patients through each phase of their wellness program, from dazed and confused newbie to healthy and focused wellness warrior.</p>
<p>‘But, Doc,” you might say, “do I really need a health coach?” For most people, I’d say absolutely! Just like having a fitness trainer at the gym or a mentor at the office, when you’ve got a pro to help light the way, achieving your goals becomes a lot easier. Could you do this on your own? Sure, but I believe your experience will be richer, more successful and even more profound with a health coach to make the trip with you – and here’s why:</p>
<h3>1. Your Health Coach Creates a Plan That’s Tailored to Your <em>Exact S</em>ituation</h3>
<p>In addition to your specific health concerns, daily real-life responsibilities, stress levels and work/family dynamics all effect how well you’re able to integrate new, healthier habits. With a health coach as your wellness co-pilot, you’ll work together to develop a customized plan that takes your individual physical, emotional and lifestyle factors into account and fits with the way you live – and ultimately leads you to permanent, positive change.</p>
<h3>2. Your Health Coach Helps Make Change Safer and Better for Your Body</h3>
<p>Virtually every day questionable diet and fitness fads hit the market, pushed along by slick marketing campaigns, promoted on TV, touted in magazines, spread from fitness trainers to their clients, or from one office co-worker to the next. Some fads are downright dangerous, and others may be less so, but they can still have negative, energy-sapping side effects that aren’t worth compromising your health over. To develop a plan that sustains your body as it gets it to a healthier place, put a trained, professional health coach on your wellness team. They’ll help you identify and integrate sensible, sustainable practices to enhance your health, and raise red flags as needed. No fainting, hair loss, hunger or light-headedness necessary.</p>
<h3>3. Your Health Coach Knows How to Get Granular With Your Health</h3>
<p>Most primary care physicians know that nutrition, stress reduction, weight management and exercise are important, but know little about actual, specific wellness practices or innovations. Consequently, few health care providers are able to offer patients recommendations much beyond “lose some weight,” or “eat more salads.” A health coach, however, is prepared to get granular, to drill down and identify the latest, best techniques to help get you the results you (and your doctor) are after. An at-your-service concierge.</p>

									st_summary='I joined a CSA this year that has provided such a beautiful bounty - and that’s what inspired this recipe! It’s seasonal, grounding and delicious. The blend of spicy and sweet is truly satisfying. 


Servings: 4-6
Ingredients:
1 small butternut squash, peeled, seeded and chopped
1 big parsnip (or a few smaller ones), peeled and chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 apple (optional), peeled, cored and chopped
4 cup organic vegetable broth
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp curry powder
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp dried thyme


Directions:
Place all ingredients in the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours. After it’s cooked, either transfer the ingredients to a blender and blend in batches until smooth or using an immersion blender, blend until smooth in the slow cooker.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-39 current-cat"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/health-wellness/" title="I believe that there is a continuum between optimal health and disease. And what I see in my practice everyday is how different grades of sub-optimal functioning can appear at any point along it. For example, before your car’s brake pads give in and your brakes fail, years of wear and tear have been slowly eroding the pads. The same thing happens with our health. Before we develop a disease, or even symptoms, there have usually been months or years of progressive “wearing down” of optimal functioning. Our body has a large reserve, which it uses to maintain health, but it can be depleted or worn down over time. Only then do we experience disease, it doesn’t just happen out of the blue. 

To use a natural metaphor, when a plant is sick or not doing well, it is crucial to look at the environment within which the plant is growing – what is the quality of the soil, is it getting enough nutrients, does it have enough sun or water, are roots or bugs from other plants impinging on its growth. This is exactly how I see our health and my role as a physician is to improve, promote and boost the bodies natural healing ability. This fosters immunity and resilience to illness, allowing us to truly blossom and experience good health.

My method is simple but effective:  I remove what may be harming the body or preventing healing while at the same time replenishing it with what is needed. Unfortunately, most doctors do not see the health this way as we are trained to treat symptoms of disease as opposed to learning what keeps people healthy. We are taught crisis care medicine in hospitals and how to take care of acutely ill patients. But most of us are not sick enough to be in hospital and we have chronic conditions that are not dealt with well by this medical model. So we need to use Western Medicine wisely and appropriately, which often means looking beyond it, for solutions to our chronic and ongoing health problems.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-106"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/health-wellness/detoxification/" title="As a culture, we are very aware of our external cleanliness.  We keep our cities and streets clean, brush our teeth and bathe and wash our hair frequently because we want to look, feel and smell clean.  But we do not have the same understanding of the necessity for internal cleansing or detoxification which functions to cleanse the body from the inside. Unfortunately we are all vulnerable to all sorts of toxins present in the environment, in our homes, in the personal care products we use and in the food we eat. These can have a cumulative effect on the liver and before long it becomes degraded and we start to feel sluggish or just not quite right.

The liver is the one of the main organs in the body’s detoxification system and without a healthy liver, you cannot be truly healthy or experience optimal health. I am a firm believer that an appropriately designed detox program can improve liver function and the integrity of the entire gastrointestinal system. What I see in my practice is that a safe and gentle internal cleanse once or twice a year promotes better functioning and is an important step in revitalizing your health.

Some skin conditions such as eczema, certain types of arthritis, some types of autoimmune diseases, migraine headaches, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and many non-specific symptoms may have their root cause in digestive problems.

It blends the knowledge we’ve gained from science with wisdom of ancient healing traditions. I use and recommend conventional medicine (drugs and surgery) when appropriate, but I also embrace complementary approaches, e.g. Chinese medicine, Nutritional medicine, Herbal medicine, bodywork, yoga and meditation, etc. I may use different therapeutic techniques, but I always take into account the patient’s belief systems, attitudes, feelings, social relationships, environment, patterns of eating, working, resting, sleeping and exercising and never lose sight of the body’s ability to heal itself

I believe many complex factors interact to cause disease and my method of both looking for the cause and of treatment is therefore a multi-factorial one, never losing sight of the body’s innate ability to heal itself. 

And finally, instead of suppressing symptoms with drugs, which is often like putting on a band aid masking the problem, I look for the underlying imbalances causing these symptoms or I try to uncover the root causes of the dysfunctions.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-107"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/health-wellness/hormonal-problems/" title="Most people have a negative perception of hormones. They think of teenagers having fits of anger and menopausal women having hot flashes. But balanced hormones are essential for a healthy body. The word hormone is derived from the Greek word hormon, meaning “to urge on, excite, or stimulate.” And this is exactly what they do. Hormones initiate and regulate the functioning of our cells. Made in various organs, they’re carried all over the body through the bloodstream.

Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing and treating hormonal imbalances, the conventional medical approach to endocrine problems is not very refined. Gross deficiencies and excesses of hormones can be successfully identified and treated. But subtle or early stages of hormonal imbalance are rarely detected—and therefore are not treated. At this stage of scientific knowledge, measuring blood levels of hormones is the only conventionally accepted way to make assessments. But more often than not, however, there are problems in hormonal functioning long before we can detect any abnormalities in the blood. 

The two classic examples of this are thyroid dysfunction and adrenal fatigue, both of which are extremely common and probably two of the commonest problems I see in my practice. They both present with fatigue and both can be helped by a functional approach. My experience has shown me that balancing these two systems makes a huge difference in most people’s health because all your hormones work together, so when one hormone is off, it can have a domino affect and cause imbalances of all the other hormones. Very often the problem is an imbalanced system rather than a deficiency of any hormones.">Hormonal Problems</a>

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-109"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/health-wellness/immune-related-issues/" title="Most people know the immune system as their body’s defense mechanism against illness. But your immune system also enables your body to know the difference between what is healthy and what is toxic, by recognizing it as a foreign substance and then responding to it as a perceived invader. In fact, about seventy percent of our immune system is in the digestive system because that is where we are exposed to the most foreign substances. This is another reason why the digestive system is so key to health. Optimizing function of the digestive system boosts the immune system too.

Avoiding harmful foods and chemicals, optimizing function of your digestive system, taking appropriate supplements and getting enough rest and sleep are the best ways to keep your immune system robust.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-108"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/health-wellness/musculoskeletal-problems/" title="Musculoskeletal complaints are the most common problems seen in any practice and although Western Medicine is good with acute trauma and broken bones, it is very weak with soft tissue injuries. Unfortunately most problems we see usually involve soft tissue dysfunction where muscles and connective tissues are affected. It is one of the most poorly understood and least researched aspects of the human body and is usually ignored by Western doctors. These musculoskeletal problems are relegated as relatively unimportant and we Physicians have very little training to deal with these types of problems. Diagnosis and treatment is usually anatomical, which means it is treated where the problem presents. But this doesn’t address the functional complexity involved in the perpetuation of a problem and often results in unnecessary surgeries when local treatments fail.

I have explored many different modalities to help improve the functioning of the musculoskeletal system. Treating soft tissue dysfunction is essential for good health and helps resolve many chronic problems.

Also healthy skin on the outside is reflective of our heath on the inside. Our skin absorbs and excretes both nutrients and toxins, therefore what is in the products that we apply to our skin is vitally important. Many cosmetics, including shampoos and make-up, contain a frightening cocktail of chemicals that can have a dangerous impact on health. Unfortunately, there is little regulation of the cosmetic industry except by the industry itself.

Although we may not like to admit it, many of the sleep problems we experience are the result of bad habits and behaviors. We stay up late or sleep in late. We eat foods that disagree with us or enjoy a drink late at night, oblivious to their disruptive impact on our sleep rhythms. Over time, we teach our body not to sleep and for relief we often turn to sleeping pills, which mask rather than solve the problem, and can lead to addiction.

The right food can bring out the best in your genes for a healthier life. Most of us believe that age related diseases like high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, adult onset diabetes, stroke, cancer, etc are the inevitable consequences of aging, but we are now finding out that this is not necessarily true. Healthy aging is mainly the result of how we “communicate” with our genes — through our diet!

A revolutionary new science, Nutrigenomics, is showing how different foods may interact with specific genes, how food “talks” to our genes and how our genes express themselves after the conversation. Eat the right foods and they will send instructions to your genes for good health. Eating the wrong foods however, sends messages for disease.

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-115"><a href="http://www.drfranklipman.com/category/nutrition/food-nutrition/" title="To me, healthy eating simply means removing, or limiting the foods in your diet that could be harming you and eating enough of the foods that contain the nutrients essential to your health. It is always preferable to get your nutrients from food itself rather than supplements, although replenishing nutrients using supplements is necessary, too. Most importantly, eating should be a pleasurable experience. If you are not enjoying your meals because you feel deprived or bored, your diet is not right for you.

We slept according to the rhythms of nature and our biological systems were under much less stress. But the modern world has taken a huge toll on our bodies and minds and the stress of keeping our head above water is quite different.  We may not have needed to supplement our diets then, but I strongly believe that in this day and age, supplementing with key nutrients is essential. The basic premise behind supplements as I see it is to augment our systems so that they can function optimally and do what they were designed to do. Supplements merely supplement a healthy, high-quality diet—they won’t replace one. ">Supplements</a>
