While some simply don’t think “regular” people like you and I can handle the full truth, many trainers and gun-store clerks don’t know it themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That statement is definitely not intended to sound arrogant – the fact of the matter is that I believe true preparedness requires a healthy dose of <strong>HUMILITY</strong>. We have to be willing to study and submit to <strong>REALITY</strong> – learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How</strong> violent criminals think.</li>
<li><strong>Why</strong> violent criminals do what they do.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> it statistically looks like when they attack somebody.</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> we should react and respond to save our lives when they do attack.</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> our gear and guns will and won’t behave in those situations.</li>
<li>And most importantly: how we can use all that information to become truly prepared.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The #1 Killer of Good Guys with Guns</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9303" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1_killer1.jpg" alt="1_killer" width="400" height="245" /></p>
<p>Not everyone is ready to accept and prepare for reality. It is often a more involved and less glamorous path than buying a pretty gun, shooting some bull’s-eyes, and ‘calling it good’. One of my personal heroes, Pulitzer Prize nominee Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, declares that the #1 Killer of armed Americans and police officers is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> criminals and murderers – instead, our #1 killer is <strong>DENIAL</strong>.</p>
<p>Denial is accepting misinformation as the truth. This misinformation eventually becomes myth.</p>
<p>There are a lot of myths of this lethal caliber out there regarding concealed carry. Some of these myths are not dangerous to our safety, but others absolutely are because they send us off in the wrong directions in our preparation.</p>
<p>For example, if we never learned that two-thirds of all defensive use of handguns occurs at a distance of less than 3 feet from our attackers – we’ll never know just how backward it is for us to spend 99%+ of our training squared off to a target 7 yards away.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9305" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bad_practice.jpg" alt="bad_practice" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>And if we don’t consider the reality behind that “3 foot or less” statistic – the reality that most criminals simply will not attack unless they’re able to get the drop on you – we’ll never understand the importance of building and maintaining a dependable level of comfortable, ‘auto-pilot’ situational awareness as we go throughout our days.</p>
<p>The myths and mistakes involved with concealed carry go on and on:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9344" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/power_to_weight.jpg" alt="power_to_weight" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><em>“find the gun that works for you”</em></strong> myth. At least 60% of the guns and gear out there were designed with sales and popularity in mind, <strong>not</strong> effectiveness in a fight. Which are good, which are bad, and what makes them poor choices for self-defense combat?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/handgun_hit_stats_d.jpg" alt="handgun_hit_stats_d" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The myth that <em><strong>“Accuracy in Combat = Accuracy at the Range”</strong></em>. Statistically 77%* of shots fired in self-defense situations will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">miss their targets</span>, even when fired by trained gun-handlers. Why is this the case, and how do we adjust our practice so we build effective “combat accuracy”? <em>(*collected from NYPD deadly force incidents during the mid 2000s)</em>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9357" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/radius.jpg" alt="radius" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The <em><strong>“I’ll see him coming”</strong></em> myth. Roughly 67%* of the time, the bad guy is the first one to use lethal force. They <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ambush</span> us. This tells us that a gunfight is not a clear-cut incident where a target pops up from behind a barricade. How should our thinking, awareness, and training change to give us the best chance of surviving this type of attack? <em>(*Bureau of Justice)</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/time_to_think.jpg" alt="time_to_think" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The <em><strong>“I’ll have time to think and decide”</strong></em> myth. The average violent attack is over in <strong>3 seconds</strong>. They are <strong>“blitz” attacks</strong>, designed to blindside and overwhelm us. We must be able to comprehend what’s happening, orient ourselves to that attack, draw, and begin fighting back within that 3 second window, or else there’s a very good chance we’ll be defeated before we have a chance to even draw our weapons.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9354" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/freeze.jpg" alt="freeze" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The myth of <em><strong>‘Fight or Flight’</strong></em>. The reason criminals prefer these ‘blitz attack ambushes’ is because it forces our minds into a state of reflexive reaction. The problem is, our bodies <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don’t only choose</span> between Fight and Flight, but instead between <strong>Fight, Flight, and Freeze</strong>. And without specific training, many (if not most) of us are prone to freezing for 3 or more seconds when confronted with a sudden, psychologically and physically overwhelming attack.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9355" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/one_shot.jpg" alt="one_shot" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The myth of <strong>one shot drops</strong>. 93% of single-gunshot wounds <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are survivable</span>, and in the majority of recorded gunfights, good and bad guys report not even knowing they’ve been shot until after the fight ends. Handguns do not have “stopping power”. A bullet hits with exactly as much force as the recoil of the handgun that fired it. In order to effectively stop a threat, we must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">destroy</span> something in the attacker’s body (or destroy his psychological motivation), that he needs to continue attacking us. This must be ingrained at the reflexive, muscle-memory level.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are dozens more myths that we must always keep in check if we hope to become (or remain) effectively armed, and this isn’t even considering the multitude of myths surrounding <strong>post-incident</strong> consequences involving the police and legal system.</p>
<h3>The bottom line is&#8230;</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9296" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/santa_1_small.jpg" alt="santa_1_small" width="220" height="430" /></p>
<p>The bottom line is this: The ideas that most people have of <strong>what a self-defense situation</strong> looks like are not accurate.</p>
<p>They are <strong>fantasy</strong>. They aren’t going to happen. Believing in many of these scenarios is like believing in Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The problem is this: Our view of what we stand to face dictates <strong>how</strong> we prepare.</p>
<p>And if most people’s ideas of what we may face are not accurate&#8230; that means the way most people practice is <strong>NOT</strong> setting them up for success in a real violent attack. And every ounce of research we’ve done backs this alarming trend up:</p>
<p>The way we’re taught to think about concealed carry and practice with our handguns is getting good guys killed. In fact, we declare that the entire mentality is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flawed</span> behind the classic teaching of “shout ‘stop or I’ll shoot’ and then shoot to stop the threat.”</p>
<p>We believe an entirely new approach to becoming responsibly and effectively armed is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>An approach that is scientific and looks to statistical <strong>reality</strong>, RATHER than looking at self-defense <em>anecdotally </em>through gun-range / gun-store gossip.</li>
<li>An approach that does NOT make concealed carry out to be <em>harder</em> than it really is – but one that also doesn’t sugar-coat reality by telling us that being effective is as easy as “clipping a gun on and calling it good” – because it’s not that easy. There’s more to it than that, and I think you’re well aware of that.</li>
<li>An approach that keeps concealed carry in a healthy perspective in our lives. We carry to <strong>live </strong>and to <strong>enjoy a richer, more secure life</strong>. Concealed carry is much bigger than a hobby, but it’s also not the point of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, we need an approach that helps us become <strong>ultra-effective warriors</strong> while maintaining a <strong>clear, level head</strong>. We need training that will allow us to avoid violence whenever possible, but overcome, defeat, and survive violence when we can’t avoid it.</p>
<h3>The 3 Pillar Approach to Effective Self-Defense:</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9246" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3-pillar-approach-300x225.png" alt="3-pillar-approach" width="395" height="300" /></p>
<p>This realization led me to a concept I&#8217;m spearheading through the Concealed Carry University called &#8220;<strong>The 3 Pillar Approach to Effective Self-Defense</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, most people who carry concealed are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unknowingly unprepared</span> to defend themselves because they’ve failed to look at concealed carry holistically. They don&#8217;t look at the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, where do most people begin with concealed carry? At the gun store. And hey – I made this mistake as well! But not all guns or gear are created equal – right? So how can we know what gun or holster or ammo or even which carry position we should choose BEFORE we know what a violent attack is like – or how our bodies will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REACT</span> &#8211; or how our equipment will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERFORM</span> during that attack?</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-579 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/third-pillar.jpg" alt="Third Pillar" width="110" height="300" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why gun and gear selection is – as we see it – the <strong>THIRD PILLAR</strong> of effective self-defense. Before we can look at gear, we must first look at REALITY to see how we need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">practice</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">train</span>. Which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">skills</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">abilities</span> we will need programmed on autopilot ahead of time, and which we will neither need nor want.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-578 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/second-pillar.jpg" alt="Second Pillar" width="104" height="300" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why guided training based in reality is the <strong>SECOND PILLAR</strong> of effective self-defense. Only after you know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what to practice</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to prepare</span> can you take an honest look which guns and gear will best serve you. And when you do, you&#8217;ll quickly see that at least 60% of the guns and gear out there being pushed are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing more than gimmicks</span> designed primarily only to make people FEEL safe.</p>
<p>What about the first pillar?</p>
<p>We know the 3rd pillar can’t exist without having already built the 2nd pillar. But which pillar must be built even <em>before</em> we can begin our physical training?</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-577 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/first-pillar.jpg" alt="First Pillar" width="119" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <strong>FIRST PILLAR</strong> of effective self-defense is Your MINDSET.</p>
<p>Without having the <em>Warrior Mindset</em> in place, excellent training and a reliable gun are useless. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the MINDSET that enables you to react prudently and swiftly in the moment that lethal force becomes required to save your life or other innocent lives.</p>
<p>The Mindset is what separates a sheep from a sheepdog. The Training is what makes a sheepdog dangerous. The Gear is what amplifies that sheepdog’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>And unless all Three Pillars of Effective Self-Defense are built equally strong and equally tall in our lives, our ability to defend ourselves and other innocent lives is at risk of toppling over.</p>
<p>I believe this shift in thinking is a critical element in the decision to become effectively and confidently armed.</p>
<h3>A Critical Lack of Education for the Privately-Armed Citizen&#8230;</h3>
<p>You know as well as I do, Concealed Carry and Effective Self-Defense are very deep topics that deserve some time and investment.</p>
<p>And even though I could easily spend <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the last few remaining minutes</span> that I&#8217;ve got with you here today giving some good tips on a couple of these items –here&#8217;s the thing:</p>
<p>That would only be a <strong>Band-Aid</strong>. You don&#8217;t need a band-aid, and I&#8217;m not in the business of giving people band-aids.</p>
<p>See, when I was faced with the frustrating reality that the sort of education just didn&#8217;t exist that would answer all the questions armed citizens like you and I have, &#8230;and guide us through shoring up The Three Pillars of Effective Self-Defense in our lives, I began using my position within the industry to barrel down the path <span style="text-decoration: underline;">looking for answers</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do good guys keep having to learn the sort of lessons that you just saw in that video <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the HARD WAY</span>?”</p>
<p>“Why do good guys keep having to pay for the lack of education on this subject <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with their lives</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; The deeper I dug the more <strong>disappointed</strong> I became.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the general consensus among the people who HAVE this information is that&#8230;</p>
<p>A: It&#8217;s either <em>privileged</em> information that only those in the upper echelon of law-enforcement are entitled to&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or B: &#8220;That average <em>Joe Permit Holder</em> simply can&#8217;t handle this information. They aren&#8217;t ready for it. They want to strap on a gun and say: &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There! Problem solved!</span>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
<p>And one of the most frustrating attitudes I encountered was that &#8220;Hey – if that&#8217;s what people want, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">let&#8217;s give it to them</span>.”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s keep making handguns smaller and easier to carry – never mind that they’re also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more useless</span> – and let&#8217;s keep dumping concealed carry training down further and further.”</p>
<p>And that is <strong>exactly</strong> what has happened.</p>
<p>Concealed carry training has been dumped down to the point where according to the general consensus, the only training we need is: shout &#8220;<strong>stop or I&#8217;ll shoot</strong>&#8220;, and then <em>shoot to stop the threat</em>.</p>
<p>But because you&#8217;re here, I know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you see</span> the devastating <strong>fault</strong> in this attitude.</p>
<p>I know that you understand – like I do – that saying &#8220;<em>shoot to stop the threat</em>&#8221; is like telling a second-grader:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-598 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/calculus.png" alt="Calculus" width="300" height="262" /></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Hey – calculus is easy. Just solve the equation! That&#8217;s all you have to do – solve the equation!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Okay&#8230; how?!</strong></em></p>
<p>As this briefing has demonstrated, there are some <strong>very</strong> important things that you and I need to consider and put to rest, BEFORE we are in a situation where we need to &#8220;shoot to stop the threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bottom line is, when they said that people like you and I shouldn&#8217;t have this information, or that we aren&#8217;t ready for it, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I disagreed</span> wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>I believe we Americans are a nation of warriors, and I believe that those with the desire to carry concealed should be enabled and empowered because it&#8217;s my belief that good guys with guns are one of the last remaining lines of defense –</p>
<p>&#8230;and make no mistake, there has never been <strong>a greater need</strong> for an educated and responsibly armed population than there is right now.</p>
<p>I disagreed with these naysayers wholeheartedly, and so I set out to prove two things:</p>
<p>First, that achieving a level of effective self-defense could be relatively easy.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to become a lifelong chore where you either choose between accepting <em>weakness</em> and <em>vulnerability</em> OR allowing self-defense preparation <em>to consume your entire life</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to prove that not only could gaining the <strong>mindset</strong> and <strong>training</strong> be easy and fun, but that it’s much easier than most people imagine to equip yourself with a <strong>handgun</strong> that is comfortable, concealable, as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effective</span> at getting the job done.</p>
<p>But I also wanted to prove that I could make this education and information <strong>so accessible</strong> and understandable that ANYONE could benefit from it and incorporate it into their lifestyle, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regardless</span> of their existing skill level, or their health, age, or disability.</p>
<p>I wanted to build an education tool that would take someone with an <strong>advanced</strong> degree of gun handling and concealed carry skills and make them even more effective, <strong>just as well as</strong> taking someone who is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete beginner</span> and making them truly effective and confident as well.</p>
<p>I wanted to prove that all this could be had not by spending thousands upon thousands of dollars for one-on-one classes <em>held halfway across the country which require weeks of your time</em> –</p>
<p>&#8230;but instead, that this information could be obtained <strong>for far less</strong> than the cost of your handgun itself, and could be taught on your own time, in your own home.</p>
<p>I took it upon myself to create this education mechanism, and after assembling a crack team and investing thousands of man-hours into study, research, demonstration and training, I believe we have.</p>
<h3>Our Solution.</h3>
<p>What we’ve built is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7 disc DVD program</span> you can do at your home, called &#8220;<strong>The Armed American’s Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-607 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/7-disc-program.jpg" alt="7 Disc Program 01" width="287" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is a program that we have strategically designed to guide you through the process of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">building up</span> and <strong>cementing in</strong> three strong pillars of effective self-defense in your life: the warrior mindset, the skills, and the gear and equipment selection.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/box_and_pillars.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And even though this training program contains 20 hours of charts, graphics, explanations, concepts, lectures, demonstration, case studies, real-life scenario breakdowns, and tons more – one of my biggest priorities during the production of this program was that going through the material would be a warm, fun experience for the viewer.</p>
<p>Now even though this program is relatively new, having just been released here in 2014, we&#8217;ve already put this in the hands of thousands of armed citizens, and the reception it&#8217;s been getting is incredible. It&#8217;s making big waves in the industry already. Here’s what a few recent “graduates” from this program have had to say on our Amazon page:</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: #2e75b6; line-height: 1.25;"><p><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">This is by far the very best training course I have ever seen.

<hr />
<p>Alright, now here&#8217;s something I have to make very clear upfront:</p>
<p>First, this is not an <strong>extreme</strong> training program. We’re not trying to turn you into a Navy Seal here. That said, when you finish what we’ve laid out for you here, your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mindset</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">skill</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gear</span> will be <strong>on par</strong> with some of the best out there.</p>
<p>Second, this program is for people who are ready to set aside anecdotal stories and pursue <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-defense truth</span>. It’s for people who know or who are ready to believe that ‘magic bullets’ and ‘one shot drops’ <strong>don’t exist</strong>. This program is for people who are ready to go to the next level.</p>
<p>And finally, this is <strong>not</strong> a beginner training program, and it&#8217;s <strong>not</strong> an advanced training program. This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>COMPLETE</strong></span> training program. What that means, is that regardless of where you’re at on the skill spectrum, you’re going to be challenged, pushed, and lead to a whole new level of readiness and confidence in yourself and your skills.</p>
<p>You will find no hard-nosed opinions in this program. We have no agenda other than to arm you with the truth. This program was not sponsored by any major or minor equipment manufacturer. We didn’t receive even a single penny from any sort of sponsor or advertiser. All you will get is the truth.</p>
<p>This program is based on stats compiled by thousands of armed self-defense encounters and attacks. In addition to the vast wealth of knowledge derived from the stats, you will see all of our citations and stats themselves, such as:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When</span> violence is most likely to happen&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where</span> it&#8217;s most likely to happen&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> is committing most of the violence, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> these criminals look like.</p>
<p>You will get the nitty-gritty statistics on gunfights themselves:</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">average distance</span> between the good and bad guy (or bad guys) during an attack&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How long</span> a violent attack or gunfight lasts&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How many attackers</span> there usually are on average&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How many shots</span> are fired&#8230; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What percentage</span> of those shots hit versus the percentage of those that missed&#8230;</p>
<p>This is just the <strong>tip of the iceberg</strong>.</p>
<p>Okay – at this point, I’d like to explain in greater detail what you will see, hear, and learn from each of the seven discs of this program to help you make the decision that&#8217;s right for you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-649 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/7-discs.png" alt="7 Discs" width="660" height="132" /></p>
<p><strong>Part One</strong> covers the first pillar: Mindset, and it’s made up of two discs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disc 1 called<strong> Building Your Mindset Foundation</strong>: Destroy The Top 15 Myths That Make Effective Self-Defense Impossible For Most People, and&#8230;</li>
<li>Disc 2 called<strong> Conditioning the Warrior Mindset</strong>: How The Correct Mindset Is What Separates Survivors From Victims.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/discs-part-1.jpg" alt="Part 1" /></p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first task</span> of Part One is to <strong>build</strong> the warrior mindset.</p>
<p>Having this mindset in place helps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eliminate</span> the natural human tendency to freeze when under attack.</li>
<li>Gives you the mental fortitude to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">withstand</span> the psychological pressure of a violent attack.</li>
<li>Gives you the lightning intensity of a natural born fighter, so you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respond</span> to an attack effectively.</li>
<li>This mindset renews your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motivation</span> to carry concealed, and</li>
<li>Keeps you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">balanced mentally</span> by helping you set priorities, and see clearly where concealed carry fits into your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second role</span> of Part One is to <strong>enlighten you</strong> on what violence is, the different types of violence, how violence works, and how you must leverage this knowledge in an attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being enlightened on violence helps you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">detangle</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understand</span> what is happening during an attack.</li>
<li>Why your attacker is doing what he&#8217;s doing, and what you must do to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thwart</span> and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> defeat</span> that violent mental and physical energy.</li>
<li>And when you learn these truths about violence, you will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer have</span> a disproportionate fear of criminals – because you will get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see them for who they are.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third role</span> of Part One is to <strong>bust the myths</strong> and <strong>misconceptions</strong> about concealed carry, self-defense, guns, and gear.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn the truth</span> about the top myths surrounding self-defense, concealed carry, guns, and bullets, so that you can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fully aware</span> of the realistic strengths and vulnerabilities of your body and gear.</li>
<li>Myths and bad intel make <span style="text-decoration: underline;">preparation impossible</span>, because they send you in the wrong direction, so that the harder you work, the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less prepared</span></em> for reality you are.</li>
<li>But building your mindset on truth ensures that you are preparing for what you stand the greatest chance of facing. And you will smile when you hear people discussing:
<ul>
<li>the &#8220;mysteries&#8221; of stopping power,</li>
<li>one-shot drops,</li>
<li>brandishing,</li>
<li>shooting to wound,</li>
<li>warning shots, and everything else that most armed citizens are afraid of and uncertain about&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll smile, because YOU will now know the truth.</p>
<p>And the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> final role</span> of Part One is to <strong>educate you completely</strong> on concealed carry, guns, bullets, and self-defense.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn</span> about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strange effects</span> that stress and adrenaline have on your body.</li>
<li>How to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">train mentally</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physically</span> to &#8220;vaccinate&#8221; yourself against those effects, so you&#8217;re able to act calm and cool under pressure.</li>
<li>You will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learn the 15 steps</span> that come immediately after every violent encounter, and how to behave, what to do, what not to do&#8230;, what to say and what not to say&#8230;, and how to get through each stage with your physical and financial freedom intact.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crash course</span> in concealed carry law, including how permits work, how gun free zones work, where you can and can&#8217;t carry&#8230;, and what happens if you do carry there – and how to handle a routine traffic stop.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what conditions</span> must be met for lethal force to be justified in any given situation,</li>
<li>And you’ll even learn how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">balance fear</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uncertainty</span>, how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guard</span> against concealed carry burnout, and even how to talk to and deal with people or family members who are against concealed carry.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Part One is over <strong>five hours</strong> long, and is easily the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most comprehensive</span> concealed carry education ever put in an at-home format.</p>
<p>But most importantly, when you finish Part 1, you’ll have the <strong>action-oriented mindset</strong> of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">truly effective</span> armed citizen.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re finished with part one, you can move on to Part Two – the second pillar of effective self-defense, the training.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two</strong> contains three discs called:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/discs-part-2.jpg" alt="Part 1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Disc 3 called<strong> Avoiding a Gunfight</strong>: Situational Awareness Skills, Altercation Avoidance Tactics, the ‘Escape Mentality’, and the ‘Shoot or Don’t Shoot’ Test,</li>
<li>Disc 4 called<strong> The First 2 Seconds of an Attack</strong>: Understanding The Dynamics of Violence As Used By Criminals, And How To Respond For Success, and&#8230;</li>
<li>Disc 5 called<strong> Finishing The Fight</strong>: The Principals Of Handgun Combat That Every Armed American Must Know.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first role</span> of Part Two is to <strong>drastically reduce</strong> the odds that you&#8217;ll ever be attacked.</p>
<ul>
<li>It accomplishes this by teaching you how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">turn on</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crank up</span> your situational awareness skills, to give you the ability to see danger in advance.</li>
<li>Part Two will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equip you with the knowledge</span> of where and when violence is most likely to happen,</li>
<li>&#8230;as well as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crystal clear signs</span> to look for that indicate that a person or situation or crowd is about to become violent.</li>
<li>It will arm you with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">body language</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attitude techniques</span> that make you a very unattractive target to predators and criminals,</li>
<li>&#8230;and it will educate you on some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Jedi&#8221; techniques for de-escalating</span> angry, threatening, or dominant people.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second role</span> of Part Two is to put you through the <strong>&#8220;first 2 seconds&#8221; boot camp</strong>, so you can learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> must do</span> in the first 2 seconds of an attack in order to survive and win,</li>
<li>&#8230;why you must do it, and how to quickly and easily <span style="text-decoration: underline;">develop the skills</span> and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> abilities</span> to do those things.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn all about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dynamics of an attack</span>, and how your attacker is running in what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;OODA Loop&#8221;,</li>
<li>&#8230;and why and how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disrupting that loop</span> will double or triple your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">odds of breaking his will</span> to continue attacking you.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll teach you how to permanently <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ingrain your draw stroke</span> to deploy your handgun into your muscle memory.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll install the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dynamic</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fluid concept of handgun retention</span> into your muscle memory – that is, how to never let your attacker get his hands on your gun.</li>
<li>We’ll ingrain the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instinct for lifesaving movement</span> into your muscle memory.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shoot your handgun instinctively</span>, for situations where you can&#8217;t use your handgun&#8217;s sights.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time you finish, you&#8217;ll be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">draw your gun while moving</span>, and put <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accurate shots on target</span> within the first 2 seconds of being attacked, and you will have a crystal clear understanding of why this ability makes you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">five times more likely</span> to survive a violent attack than the average armed citizen.</p>
<p>And for everything you learn, you&#8217;ll learn <em>how and why most armed citizens who try mastering these important skills go wrong</em>, and in doing so, make themselves <span style="text-decoration: underline;">worse off</span>.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third role</span> of Part Two is to teach you the gun fighting skills and strategies for <strong>finishing the fight</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn the importance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moving to cover</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to fight</span> from behind cover once you’re there.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">getting shot feels like</span>, how it&#8217;ll <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect your ability</span> to fight, and how to continue fighting despite being injured.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll master clearing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all four types of handgun malfunctions</span>, as well as how to ingrain reloading your handgun into your muscle memory.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll learn to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fight effectively from the seven different positions</span> that you&#8217;re most likely to end up in during an attack – including on the ground, and on your back.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get prepared for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reality of fighting an attacker</span> with your loved ones present, and for situations where you’re attacked in the dark.</li>
<li>And in addition to getting tips on physical fitness and how to choose and evaluate instructors and classes, you&#8217;ll get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eight Lessons of Violence</span> delivered through commentary on eight heart pounding self-defense incidences that were caught on tape – <strong>viewer discretion is advised!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Part two contains over <strong>7 1/2 hours</strong> of concealed carry training and self-defense instruction.</p>
<p>It will serve as your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete guide</span> and road-map for mastering handgun fighting, regardless of what sort of physical shape you are in, or how old you are.</p>
<p>When you are finished with Part Two, you can move on to Part Three, where we cover the third pillar of self-defense, the guns, gear, and equipment involved with concealed carry.</p>
<p><strong>Part Three</strong> contains two discs:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/discs-part-3.jpg" alt="Part 1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Disc 6 called <strong>The Armed Citizen’s Tools and Gear</strong>: How To Effectively Evaluate All Gear, and How To Select A Gun, Caliber, Ammunition, A Carry Position, and a Concealed Carry Holster, and&#8230;</li>
<li>Disc 7 called <strong>The Armory</strong>: Evaluating Extras (From Spare Magazines and Flashlights to Memberships and Attorneys), Gear Maintenance, And the Physical Effects of Bullets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first role</span> of Part Three is to teach you how to <strong>evaluate guns and gear</strong> based on the demands of reality, rather than appearance or gimmicks – which wind up fooling most armed citizens.</p>
<ul>
<li>By memorizing our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Filters of Self-Defense Gear Evaluation</span>, you&#8217;ll be able to throw 60% of the guns and gear out as junk, without even picking the gun or gear up, let alone having to go through the process of buying and trying it.</li>
<li>And by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">measuring your current or future gear</span> against our “reality filter”, you&#8217;ll always know that you&#8217;ve got a gun, carry position, holster, and ammunition that won&#8217;t let you down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second role</span> of Part Three is to dive deep into the <strong>important things we need to think about</strong> when deciding on every aspect of concealed carry gear.</p>
<ul>
<li>We begin by explaining <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Nine Factors of Self-Defense Handgun Evaluation</span>, and why it&#8217;s a mistake to overlook any of those nine factors.</li>
<li>We discuss <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how characteristics</span> such as caliber size, ammunition capacity, manufacturer, and firing mechanism all play critical roles in how able that gun is to save your life,</li>
<li>&#8230;and how factors such as the gun’s height, length, width, and weight all work together to determine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how comfortable</span> (or painful) that gun is to carry concealed.</li>
<li>For each of these factors, we give you the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolute &#8220;bare minimums&#8221;</span> based on the outcomes of real-life gunfights as well as our personal recommendations for guns and gear,</li>
<li>&#8230;and even guidelines on how wide, tall, long, and heavy handgun can be while still being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">comfortable and concealable</span> for your specific body type.</li>
<li>And finally, we tell you how to access the chart that we&#8217;ve made which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compares the top 147 most popular self-defense handguns</span>, based on these nine factors, so you can easily see how these guns compare to one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the first chapter on handgun selection – <strong>the first chapter of 20</strong>.</p>
<p>We apply that same level of thorough detail to the selection of every piece of gear or method that you have to choose from.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to choose where on your body you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">carry your gun</span>.</li>
<li>How to choose a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">holster</span>.</li>
<li>How to decide on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">caliber</span>, where we show you various bullets hitting simulated tissue at 15,000 frames per second so you can see how much damage these bullets do and don&#8217;t do.</li>
<li>How to choose what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ammunition</span> to use.</li>
<li>And the facts on all the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accessories</span> like lasers, pepper spray, tazers, flashlights, training accessories, air soft training devices, memberships in organizations, and self defense attorneys.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time you finish Part Three, <strong>you will be an expert!</strong></p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third role</span> of the two discs of Part Three is to teach you <strong>how to maintain</strong> your concealed carry gear, so that it&#8217;s always ready in perfect working order at the drop of a hat.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve got a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">40 minute demonstration</span> on how to completely disassemble and thoroughly clean your handgun, and how to spot the signs that it&#8217;s time to perform this deep cleaning.</li>
<li>We demonstrate how to perform the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weekly 60-Second Functionality Check</span>, and we discuss why this is so important to do.</li>
<li>We go over <span style="text-decoration: underline;">holster maintenance</span> and warning signs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ammunition rotation</span> and warning signs, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">magazine maintenance</span> and warning signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part Three is over <strong>6.5 hours</strong> long. We cover it all, and when you finish Part Three, you&#8217;ll be vastly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more educated</span> than 90% of trainers, and 95% of the people working behind the counters in gun stores.</p>
