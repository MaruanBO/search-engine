Top: Akhil Lodha. Bottom: Mike Furlong" width="266" height="350" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Top: Akhil Lodha. Bottom: Mike Furlong</p></div><p>One goal after <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/taking-a-leap-of-faith-retiring-on-own-terms/" target="_blank">leaving my corporate job</a> of 11 years in 2012 was to learn more about the startup industry in Silicon Valley. I was coming from the old school finance industry where there was relatively little innovation compared to many financial technology companies today. Life was getting a little boring and I kept watching company after company we took public grow into great successes.</p><p>One of those companies was Google. I remember being excited seeing Sergei Brin, one of Google&#8217;s founders give a lunch presentation in downtown San Francisco during their IPO roadshow back in August, 2004. It was standing room only, so I wasn&#8217;t able to eat one of the manufactured plates of rubber chicken. We were one of the lead book runners, and I was inspired at how quickly Sergei, Larry and team were able to build something so huge, so quickly.</p><p>We are living in the golden age of tech/internet innovation. Five years ago, at age 32, I told myself that if I didn&#8217;t create something internet-related on my own or join a startup while having so much access living in San Francisco, I would kick myself in the face when I&#8217;m old.</p><p>Today, Google is one of my largest sources of traffic and revenue for Financial Samurai. Maybe it&#8217;s good karma for helping them go public, even though the IPO seemed shaky at the time with the last minute price decision of $85/share. Yes, we all should have piled in back then! It&#8217;s crazy how life comes full circle.</p><p>After some research, I&#8217;ve decided to consult for a couple months part-time for <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/whyhedgefunds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sliced Investing</a> here in San Francisco! I discovered Sliced Investing on AngelList while vacationing up in Tahoe over Christmas break. With my tag-line &#8220;Slicing Through Money&#8217;s Mysteries,&#8221; I wondered if destiny was calling once again as I shot the founders a note to say I&#8217;m interested in helping them out. They kindly responded, and here I am.</p><p>I wrote off hedge fund investing until 2015 because I didn&#8217;t have the $500,000+ minimums to invest. It was just as well since the markets have been on fire since 2009 and hedge funds have underperformed. But in a way, I have been creating my own equity hedged portfolio with my accumulation of <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/understanding-structured-derivative-products-cdsnote-as-an-investment/" target="_blank">structured products</a> since 2012. Give me 5-10% returns every year with low volatility, and I&#8217;ll happily invest all I can.</p><p>Sliced Investing smartly crowd-sources investor capital in order to make investing in hedge funds and alternatives more accessible to more people due to their minimum investment of $20,000. With the bull market entering its sixth year, I&#8217;m beginning to wonder how much more this baby can run. I&#8217;ll take under a 10% return for the S&amp;P 500 for 2015 if anybody wants to take the other side of the bet!</p><p>In this interview, I want to understand the mindset of an entrepreneur. We&#8217;ll talk about risk-taking, the why, and how things came to be with Mike Furlong and Akhil Lodha, founders of Sliced Investing. I&#8217;ve got to imagine many people would love to be their own bosses and create a company one day as well. </p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-startup-journey-alternative-investing-with-sliced-investing-founders/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-49322 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-real-estate entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-make-lots-of-money-in-real-estate/" rel="bookmark">How To Make Lots Of Money In Real Estate: Focus On Expansion</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-make-lots-of-money-in-real-estate/#comments">35 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><div id="attachment_49688" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-49688" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FS-hot-tub-party-350x263.jpg?0c052b" alt="Remodeling and Expanding" width="350" height="263" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Building The FS Hot Tub!</p></div><p>In 2014, I bought a fixer for about $714 / square a square foot in the Golden Gate Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. Nobody really knows where the neighborhood is, and that&#8217;s just the way I like it because everybody eventually will! Golden Gate Heights is just several blocks west of UCSF and has <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-best-area-to-buy-property-in-san-francisco-or-any-major-city-today/" target="_blank">homes facing the Pacific Ocean</a>.</p><p>Real estate is my favorite asset class to build wealth because it is tangible, inflates with inflation, has preferential tax benefits, and provides an income stream if rented out. When I buy real estate, I&#8217;m the CEO of the property. When I buy a stock, I&#8217;ve got to trust the CEO and his or her management team to execute. Sometimes the CEO is great, sometimes the CEO sucks wind, yet still gets a multi-million dollar exit package that makes me sick.</p><p>Nobody cares more about your money than you. Hence, the goal for wealth builders is to own investments where you can better control the outcome. And if you can&#8217;t own investments that you control, <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/questions-to-ask-think-before-hiring-a-financial-advisor/" target="_blank">let someone you trust manage your money</a> if you don&#8217;t have confidence in managing your money yourself. I trust myself to work harder and scrutinize expenses and revenue more than anybody. My bottleneck is time.</p><p>In this post, I&#8217;d like to point out a very important rule before buying any single family home.

I&#8217;ve always been someone to find solutions, rather than complain or pontificate why such and such is the way things are. Perhaps it&#8217;s the MBA side of me that always encourages problem-solving. Or maybe it&#8217;s the do-or-die ex-banker side of me who always had to close a deal or else I would never get paid or promoted. <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/welfare-to-well-off-financial-independence-journey/" target="_blank">Taking action</a> is always better than sitting on your ass, and just hoping things will get better.</p><p>But I&#8217;m torn by money because I&#8217;ve seen the entire spectrum of wealth; from the slums and favelas of India and Brazil to the mega-mansions in Pacific Heights and The Hamptons. Life is not fair. Some of us are born with a great foundation for achieving wealth. A few of us are born already wealthy thanks to the trust funds set up by thoughtful parents. However, the vast majority of us are <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/definitions-of-a-middle-class-income-do-you-consider-yourself-middle-class/" target="_blank">born middle class or poor</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve always thought one of the greatest ways to give back if you don&#8217;t have much money is to share what you know with others; to be a mentor<strong>.</strong> I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have two supportive parents who enabled me to study hard, think for myself, and take some risks. I often question &#8220;why me?&#8221; for achieving <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-build-passive-income-for-financial-independence/" target="_blank">financial independence earlier than normal</a> when I worked no harder, and am certainly no smarter than many other people.</p><p>To deal with my question, I simply write, and write, and write so that perhaps I may be able to help others seeking answers to a financial problem. The internet is truly the best medium for gaining knowledge today.</p><p>On October 20, 2012 I wrote a post entitled, &#8220;Financial Samurai Career &amp; Personal Finance Coaching.&#8221; The post&#8217;s purpose was to help those who wanted 1-on-1 personal finance help from me beyond the free content that I write. I <strong>never published the post</strong> because I was embarrassed to charge any money to help people. It felt off to charge for advice given I&#8217;ve never charged anybody a penny since 2009. I&#8217;ve even welcomed people who don&#8217;t pay a cent to openly berate me about my ideas and opinions.</p><p>After a month of sitting on the post, I decided to finally put it up in my menu tab bar on the homepage without any public announcement. People did take notice to the tune of around five clients a month, but I didn&#8217;t have time, so I raised the price to $600 an hour in order to work with just two to three clients a month and it worked&#8230; for a while. However, I took the page on the menu tab off altogether because demand started growing again unbelievably. </p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/level-the-financial-playing-field/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-45902 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-savings category-relationships entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/who-should-pay-for-the-wedding-follow-the-10-wedding-payment-rule/" rel="bookmark">Who Should Pay For The Wedding?

Spending $25,000 &#8211; $30,000 on the average cost of a wedding in America if you make a median household income of $52,000. What&#8217;s worse is going into debt to get married, especially since there&#8217;s a 50% chance it won&#8217;t last!</p><p>In many Asian countries, the parents of the bride foot the entire wedding bill because of the now backwards idea that the husband is &#8220;relieving&#8221; the parents of the financial costs of caring for their daughter. I can hear many Westerns scoffing at this way of thinking, but before the 1970s it was rare to have dual income households in America. One of my neighbors is a 30-something year old woman who still lives with her 55+ year old Chinese mother. Living with your parents until marriage is quite commonplace for many Asian and Hispanic cultures.</p><p>The one thing many Asian weddings have that Western weddings don&#8217;t have is the ability to make money during your wedding. I went to my friend&#8217;s wedding in Taipei and he actually made about $100,000 from his 50 table, 400 person wedding. The Chinese have a culture of giving monetary gifts in the form of red envelopes during weddings and Lunar New Year. If you are a business associate invited to the wedding, you better give at least $500-$1,000 or else you might not have much business left for the year!</p><p>In many Western countries, the parents of the groom pay for all wedding expenses. The thought process is that the groom&#8217;s parents are honored to have such a wonderful woman be their son&#8217;s life partner to love and care for him through sickness, health, wealth, and poverty. I like this thought process a lot, but as <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/definitions-of-a-middle-class-income-do-you-consider-yourself-middle-class/" target="_blank">a son of middle class parents</a> who went to a <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/should-i-go-to-public-school-or-private-school/" target="_blank">cheap public school</a>, I would feel bad for my parents to pay. I&#8217;d rather pay the bill and have my parents keep their money to enjoy in retirement instead.</p><p>Finally, there&#8217;s a growing trend for many lovebirds to pay for the large majority of their wedding cost themselves. Out of the past five weddings I&#8217;ve attended, all five were predominantly paid for by the bride and groom. I&#8217;ve asked other 25-40 year olds and they&#8217;ve said the same thing. Perhaps parents might pay for the venue, or the flowers, but certainly not everything.</p><p>One of the main reasons why more wedding costs are born on the bride and groom is because they want their wedding to be a certain way.

For example, if Goldman Sachs decided to create a special opportunity fund for institutions because they saw opportunity in the Argentinian debt market, employees would have the opportunity to invest alongside some of the world&#8217;s largest money managers like Fidelity, Capital, and Franklin Templeton. Random investment opportunities came up all the time.</p><p>After two years as a financial analyst at GS in NYC, I knew my days were numbered as the NASDAQ dotcom bubble burst in March 2000. I remember optimistically telling my VP in May 2000 how I was still bullish on the markets and he sternly told me, &#8220;We&#8217;re in a bear market. Stop kidding yourself.&#8221; Three years later, more than half of my analyst class was let go.</p><p>By June 2000, it was clear the NASDAQ was not getting better. I can&#8217;t remember exactly how things played out, but I think management sent out an internal e-mail to all employees about how we should keep focusing on our clients &#8211; that now was the best time to give them a call or take them out because nobody else was. In the employee memo, management also indicated they had added some new options to our 401k retirement plan, namely several hedge funds that looked to profit from the downturn.</p><p>Given some of our smartest and most profitable clients were hedge funds, I decided to do some research and invest half of my 401k into a technology hedge fund, Andor Capital Management, founded by Daniel Benton. Andor was one of Goldman&#8217;s largest clients, and they formed some type of partnership where they would let employees invest without needing the $1 million+ minimums. The flagship Andor technology fund ended up returning 35 percent in 2000, net of fees, and my 401k actually inched up in 2000 and 2001 as a result of the hedge fund investment instead of getting slaughtered.</p><p>I kept my GS 401k until 2003, despite moving to a new firm in June 2001, due to the investment selection. But after it felt like the markets were out of the woods, and since I could no longer contribute to my GS 401k hedge fund as an ex-employee, I consolidated my 401k balance at my new firm to keep things streamlined. </p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-investing-in-a-hedge-fund-saved-my-retirement-portfolio/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-48415 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-career category-investments entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-long-will-the-average-person-take-to-earn-one-million-dollars-around-the-world/" rel="bookmark">How Long Will The Average Person Take To Earn $1 Million Around The World?</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-long-will-the-average-person-take-to-earn-one-million-dollars-around-the-world/#comments">57 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>The Economist put out an interesting chart highlighting how long it takes the median household income to earn $1 million dollars before tax.

It takes discipline doing research on investable assets, which is probably one of the reasons why many people don&#8217;t even bother.</p><p>One of the biggest push backs I hear from readers who want to get rich, but don&#8217;t have enough disposable income to invest, is that investing costs too much and is too complicated.

Although I generally advise against sharing all of one&#8217;s financial details, if the figures are reasonable, then that&#8217;s probably fine. Otherwise, the pitchforks will be focused on those who brazenly display obnoxious amounts of wealth with no regard for others. May Stealth Wealth live on in us all.</p><p>Remember, it&#8217;s more about <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-should-my-net-worth-or-savings-be-based-on-income/" target="_blank">what you have to show for your income</a>, not so much about how much you make.

Given he has around $37,000 in cash, the next time I see him at a conference boondoggle, of course I&#8217;m going to let him buy me a steak dinner! Instead of letting his cash earn nothing in a money market account, he might as well take care of his friends right?</p><p>What I noticed about his net worth picture is how pleasantly streamlined it is. He has no more than 10 financial accounts to track. Have a look.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48584" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/J-net-worth.png?0c052b" alt="Net Worth Chart" width="483" height="228" /></p><p>After seeing J&#8217;s net worth chart, I got to thinking about how complicated my own net worth picture is. I used to track my net worth with an Excel spreadsheet every single month since 2000. It was pretty fun for a personal finance enthusiast like me, but it started getting a little cumbersome after my account total grew. By the time <a href="http://personalcapital.go2cloud.org/SHDk" target="_blank">I aggregated my accounts online in 2012</a>, I had 25 accounts to track. I felt relieved when I no longer had to write everything down and update figures every month. Now everything just gets updated automatically thanks to technology.</p><p>But something funny happens when you just leverage technology to track your net worth. You stop being as analytical with your finances as you used to because you just rely on technology to do everything for you. In other words, you start getting a little lazy. Laziness is a net worth killer because it prevents you from taking action when opportunities arise, e.g. refinancing a mortgage.</p><p>My net worth has grown since 2012, like I&#8217;m sure most of your net worths have. What I&#8217;m curious to know is how many financial accounts I have now, because I haven&#8217;t checked in over a year! Perhaps you&#8217;ll share your count as well.</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-better-manage-a-complicated-net-worth/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-48791 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-mortgages entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-get-the-lowest-mortgage-interest-rate-possible/" rel="bookmark">How To Get The Lowest Mortgage Interest Rate Possible</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-get-the-lowest-mortgage-interest-rate-possible/#comments">69 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47287" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tiburon-view-350x262.jpg?0c052b" alt="Time to refinance a mortgage once again" width="350" height="262" />I must be mad, because after multiple mortgage refinances, I&#8217;ve decided to take my own advice on <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/improve-cash-flow-for-financial-independence/" target="_blank">improving my cash flow further</a> by trying to refinance my mortgage again! I say &#8220;trying&#8221; because getting a mortgage or refinancing a mortgage is still not a slam dunk like it was pre-2007.</p><p>Lending standards are strict with ~729 being the average credit score for denied mortgage applicants. Furthermore, my debt-to-income ratio could be a problem because 100% of my 1099 (freelance income) won&#8217;t count for 2014 because banks require two years of 1099 income, and I&#8217;ve only got 14 months worth.</p><p>Can you believe that? Even if I made $800,000 in freelance income over the past twelve months, big banks would still disavow all of it and likely reject even a small mortgage refinance amount if I had no other income. Banks should discount 1099 income by some amount, but not by 100%. There&#8217;s a growing misconception now that full-time income is more stable. A full-time employee is betting on one horse. An independent contractor can bet on multiple horses.</p><p>Now is absolutely the time to refinance because the 10-year treasury yield has fallen below 1.8% (1.68% as of 2/2/2015). We&#8217;re back to all-time lows. Volatility is up, collapsing oil prices are stoking fears of weak global consumer demand, and chaos reigns once again in Europe. I&#8217;m glad there isn&#8217;t anymore US government shutdown drama at the very least.</p><p>I&#8217;ve got two years left on a ~$1 million dollar jumbo 5/1 ARM at $4,338 a month at 2.625%. My goal is to refinance this puppy down to a 2.25% 5/1 ARM at $3,822 a month, for a cost of less than $3,000. The annual interest savings is $3,750, and the monthly cash flow increase is $516 or $6,192 a year.

Woof</p></div><p>One of my regrets between 2007-2012 was not aggressively entertaining other job offers. By 2007, I had been with my previous company for six years and felt tremendous loyalty to the firm. How could I hop to a competitor for more money when my company first gave me a chance here in San Francisco? I now wonder whether the reason why I stayed at my firm for 11 consecutive years is because of my <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-overcome-money-guilt/" target="_blank">predisposition to feel guilty</a> whenever something good happens.</p><p>Instead of leaving for another firm, I simply asked my boss in a nice way what I should do if they were me when I was getting aggressively courted. They always told me to stay and simply offered me a raise between what I was getting paid and what I was being offered by a competing firm. I never pushed them to match because I didn&#8217;t want to create a hostage scenario of resentment. Wall Street income is relatively absurd compared to practically every other industry, so I found it always distasteful when people complained about their bonuses.</p><p>But if I managed my career perfectly, I could have made $400,000 more after tax if I had accepted a juicy, two-year guaranteed income offer at another firm in NYC from 2010-2011. I left Wall Street in 2012 anyway, so it didn&#8217;t matter that I was going from a bulge bracket firm to a lower tier firm because I was never going back to finance.</p><p>Even after a four-hour interview with the interested company&#8217;s CEO in NYC, who so happened to be the eldest son of China&#8217;s former Premier, I still couldn&#8217;t take the leap out of loyalty to my firm. If you were a fly on the wall during our interview, you would have thought that I was some type of superstar based on the praise he gave. I stood stubbornly strong like a patriotic soldier and politely declined multiple times after.</p><p>NYC is a great place to visit, but <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/east-coast-living-is-it-really-that-bad/" target="_blank">pretty much sucks</a> in terms of cost and work/life balance. Besides entering a much more stressful lifestyle for two years if I took the job, I was also hesitant to sell my house in 2010 given the real estate market was still depressed. Another concern was whether or not the courting firm would actually pay the second year guarantee if the first year performance results were not up to expectations. I heard stories of companies luring employees in with great promises only to welch during the second year. What was the new employee supposed to do after getting screwed in the second year but suck it up, sue his employer, or find another job. It&#8217;s not as easy finding another job if you&#8217;re coming from a small shop.</p><p>Although I missed out on some heavy dollars, at least I was able to <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-make-money-quitting-your-job-2/" target="_blank">negotiate a severance package</a> from my firm of 11 years that lightened the blow. It would have been impossible to negotiate a severance if I quit after a two-year guarantee at the new firm. Manhattan is a wonderful playground if you have money. Alas, I&#8217;ll never know.</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/is-company-loyalty-costing-you-a-fortune/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-48240 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/its-impossible-to-stay-retired-once-you-retire-early/" rel="bookmark">It&#8217;s Impossible To Stay Retired Once You Retire Early</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/its-impossible-to-stay-retired-once-you-retire-early/#comments">81 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48503" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/retired-couple-350x232.jpg?0c052b" alt="Retired couple by Sebastian Flickr Creative Commons" width="350" height="232" />In the spring of 2012, I hung up my sword after working in finance since 1999. There was actually a hiccup the very last day of work, a Friday. When I was e-mailing some personal files from my work account to my personal account (pictures, tax docs, etc), I inadvertently e-mailed a five year old client file that was caught by compliance. I was warned this was a violation of company policy and that I would be hearing from them about any repercussions the next week. I apologized for the mistake and waited nervously about the fate of my severance check.</p><p>To allay my worries, I actually went to a free Hastings School Of Law community service event where law students and professors helped those with legal questions. They just so happened to host the event on what I thought was the first free weekend of the rest of my life. It was great to see the school give back to literally hundreds of people regarding questions about divorce, employment, accidents, theft, trusts, and more.</p><p>My question to a professor and to a law student was simply, &#8220;<em>Can my firm take away the agreed upon severance contract due to a five year old company file that I inadvertently sent to myself?</em>&#8221; Financial companies are notoriously strict about ex-employees transferring sensitive client documents that can be advantageously used against their old employer if they join a competitor. I told my company that I was retiring from the finance business altogether, but how could they know I was really telling the truth? In our business, few people voluntarily walk away from such paychecks.</p><p>After getting comforting council saying that I should be fine, I promised that day to NEVER go back to work in finance if I could still get my severance and deferred compensation. My new manager was in from New York City that day and was already busting my balls for the incident. I went a step further and promised to never go back to working for anybody. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were at stake and I was worried.</p><p>HR called me the following Tuesday and told me everything was fine in the end. They agreed the client file was irrelevant given it was five years old, and accepted my e-mail apology for the mistake. Once I got my severance check several weeks later I felt like I had sheepishly won the lottery. Instead of spending it all, I sat on it like I would any financial windfall. By the summer of 2012, the market had taken a little dive and I finally <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/understanding-structured-derivative-products-cdsnote-as-an-investment/" target="_blank">invested the entire amount in the stock market</a> so as to make it disappear. I wanted to stay hungry and pretend I received nothing. </p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/its-impossible-to-stay-retired-once-you-retire-early/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-48365 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-motivation entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/make-more-money-save-more-cash-grow-your-net-worth-now/" rel="bookmark">Make More Money, Save More Cash, Grow Your Net Worth Now!</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/make-more-money-save-more-cash-grow-your-net-worth-now/#comments">85 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-48384" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/big-mountain-climb-350x263.jpg?0c052b" alt="Big Goals by Sergiy Matusevych" width="350" height="263" />Happy New Year Everyone!</p><p>I hope everybody is locked and loaded to get&#8230; loaded again in 2015!

I&#8217;ve had hundreds of people ask me this question over the years, and I&#8217;ve also struggled to figure out a good guideline for myself.  As a result, I&#8217;ve been racking my brain to figure out a viable solution that can be used by many.</p><p>The solution I&#8217;ve come up with is called, &#8220;Financial Samurai&#8217;s DAIR&#8221; or &#8220;FS DAIR&#8221; for short. The idea is to come up with something easy to remember, challenging, logical, and effective, much like the <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-110th-rule-for-car-buying-everyone-must-follow/" target="_blank">1/10th rule for car buying</a> to help folks maximize their wealth. Even though plenty of people have objected to my 1/10th rule for being too restrictive, I strongly believe the rule has helped people minimize financial regret and boost the incredible feeling of progress and financial security.</p><p>Since we are all CFOs of our finances, we need to figure out the most efficient use of capital. My goal is to make personal finance simple so ACTION can be taken. All talk and no action leads to nothing. I&#8217;d like to &#8220;DAIR&#8221; you to follow my debt pay down rule to achieve financial freedom sooner, rather than later.</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/pay-down-debt-or-invest-implement-fs-dair/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-32155 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-most-popular category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/what-does-early-retirement-feel-like-the-positives-and-negatives/" rel="bookmark">What Does Early Retirement Feel Like?

Financial independence is usually applicable to people across their entire lifespan. Those who cashed out $5 million dollars worth of Facebook stock at the age of 30 are financially independent just like those who saved $5 million in their retirement funds by the age of 65.</p><p>Retirement, on the other hand, is a term often used to describe someone in the last quarter of their lives e.g. ages 65 and up. This is why some folks get so hot and bothered if you aren&#8217;t in the upper ages but say you are retired. They don&#8217;t think you deserve retirement because you&#8217;re not old enough! If you don&#8217;t want unwanted attention as an early retiree, just say you are unemployed, on sabbatical, or an entrepreneur.</p><p>The reality is all of us would rather be financially independent earlier, so we have more time to enjoy our wealth. When the director of admissions at Berkeley asked why I was applying so early (25), I told her it was because I knew what I wanted to do and felt it best to leverage an MBA degree sooner, for a longer period of time. Little did I know I&#8217;d be done 10 years later.</p><p>The older we get the more we are willing to trade money for time since we have less of it. Given I&#8217;ve already described <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2012/11/11/how-does-it-feel-to-be-financially-independent/" target="_blank">what financial independence feels like</a>, I&#8217;d like to now describe what life is like once you no longer have to report for duty. I&#8217;ll be as candid as possible so you can get a realistic understanding.</p><h2><span style="color: #333333;">THE CHANGED LIFE OF A RETIRED MAN &#8211; <span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #008000;">THE POSITIVES</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/what-does-early-retirement-feel-like-the-positives-and-negatives/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div><p></span></span></span></h2></div></article><article class="post-35697 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-investments category-most-popular category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/recommended-net-worth-allocation-mix-by-age-and-work-experience/" rel="bookmark">Recommended Net Worth Allocation By Age And Work Experience</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/recommended-net-worth-allocation-mix-by-age-and-work-experience/#comments">119 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-35763" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SquawValley-300x224.jpg?0c052b" alt="Squaw Valley USA, Lake Tahoe " width="300" height="224" />With the average savings rate below 5%, a median 401(k) of only $100,000, and an average 401(k) balance at retirement age 60 of around $230,000, most Americans are financially screwed in 2014. Just do the math yourself. Add the average Social Security payment per person of $18,000 a year to a 4% withdrawal rate on $230,000 and you get $27,200 a year to live happily until you die at 85.</p><p>Let&#8217;s think about this some more. You spend almost 40 years of your life working just to live off minimum wage in retirement. Hopefully you were able to live it up during your working years, otherwise, how else can we explain a national sub 5% savings rate? Blowing lots of money for fun is fine if you expect to live like a pauper when you&#8217;re old. The better way to do things is to smooth out your spending across your expected life expectancy to reduce stress and live a much steadier lifestyle.</p><p>We&#8217;ve talked in detail about the <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2013/01/28/the-proper-asset-allocation-of-stocks-and-bonds-by-age/" target="_blank">proper asset allocation of stocks and bonds by age</a>. Just know that stocks should be a minority portion of your net worth by the time you are middle age. If you so happen to have 100% of your investment allocation in stocks before retirement and 2009 happens, well then you are poop out of luck. Calculate how much you lost, equate your loss to how many years it took you to save the value of the loss, and expect to work that many more years of your life. Now that&#8217;s depressing.</p><p>We also found out that the <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2012/06/11/the-median-net-worth-trending-down/" target="_blank">median net worth for 2010</a> plunged to $77,300 from a high of $126,400 in 2007. Surely the median net worth has recovered since 2010, but such data from the government only rolls around every three years. The main nugget of information is that from 2007 to 2010, the median home equity dropped from $110,000 to $75,000. In other words, <em>the median American&#8217;s net worth almost ENTIRELY consists of home equity</em>! What another bad idea.</p><p>Finally, despite a 120%+ rebound in stocks since the bottom of the crisis and savings interest rates of only 0.1% due to a dovish Fed, a lot of people missed out on the recovery as evidenced by a tremendous amount of cash still sitting on the sidelines due to fear. Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn is suing Apple for hoarding their $134 billion in cash due to a &#8220;grandma depression mentality.&#8221; Anybody who has lived through the 1997 Russian Ruble crisis, the 2000 internet bubble, and 2006 housing correction probably has a good portion of their net worth in CDs, bonds, and money markets because they&#8217;ve been burned so many times before.</p><p>The question we must all ask ourselves is, &#8220;<em>What is the right net worth allocation to allow for the most comfortable financial growth?</em>&#8221; There is no easy answer to this question as everybody is of different age, intelligence, work ethic, and risk tolerance. I will attempt to address this question based based on what has worked for me, and what I believe will work for anybody who is serious about building enduring financial wealth for the long run. I&#8217;ve spent over 10 hours writing this post in hopes that every Financial Samurai reader can build a rock steady net worth portfolio to make money in good times and lose less in bad times.</p><h2><span style="color: #000000;">THE MENTAL FRAMEWORK FOR NET WORTH ALLOCATION</span></p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/recommended-net-worth-allocation-mix-by-age-and-work-experience/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></h2></div></article><article class="post-34760 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-investments category-most-popular category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-proper-asset-allocation-of-stocks-and-bonds-by-age/" rel="bookmark">The Proper Asset Allocation Of Stocks And Bonds By Age</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-proper-asset-allocation-of-stocks-and-bonds-by-age/#comments">48 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47778" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yin-yang-balanced-spending-350x233.jpg?0c052b" alt="Proper Asset Allocation Of Stocks And Bonds by Andrew MacGill Flickr Creative commons" width="350" height="233" />To start, there is no &#8220;correct&#8221; asset allocation by age. Your asset allocation between stocks and bonds depends on your risk tolerance. Are you risk averse, moderate, or risk loving? I&#8217;m personally risk loving or risk averse, and nothing in between. When I see &#8220;Neutral&#8221; ratings by research analysts, I want to slap them upside the head for having no conviction. Then the optimist in me thinks what a great world to have occupations that pay well for providing no opinion!</p><p>Your asset allocation also depends on the importance of your specific market portfolio. For example, most would probably treat their 401K or IRA as a vital part of their retirement strategy because it is or will become their largest portfolio. Meanwhile, you can have another portfolio in an after-tax brokerage account like E*Trade that is much smaller where you punt stocks. If you blow up your E*Trade account, you&#8217;ll survive. If you demolish your 401K, you might need to delay retirement for years.</p><p>I ran my current 401K through <a href="http://personalcapital.go2cloud.org/SHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Personal Capital</a> to see what they thought about my aggressive asset allocation. To no surprise, the below chart is what they came back with. I essentially have too much concentration risk in stocks and am underinvested in bonds based on the &#8220;conventional&#8221; asset allocation model for someone my age. To run the same analysis on Personal Capital, simply click the &#8220;Investment Checkup&#8221; link under the &#8220;Investing&#8221; tab.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34787" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/portfolio-analysis.png?0c052b" alt="portfolio-analysis" width="600" height="196" /></p><p>I am going to provide you with five recommended asset allocation models to fit everyone&#8217;s investment risk profile: Conventional, New Life, Survival, Nothing To Lose, and Financial Samurai. We will talk through each model to see whether it fits your present financial situation. Your asset allocation will switch over time of course.</p><p>Before we look into each asset allocation model, we must first look at the historical returns for stocks and bonds. The goal of the charts is to give you basis for how to think about returns from both asset classes. Stocks have outperformed bonds in the long run as you will see. However, stocks are also much more volatile. Armed with historical knowledge, we can then make logical assumptions about the future.</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-proper-asset-allocation-of-stocks-and-bonds-by-age/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-33908 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-investments category-most-popular category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-better-manage-your-401k-for-retirement-through-scenario-analysis/" rel="bookmark">How To Better Manage Your 401K For Retirement Success</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-better-manage-your-401k-for-retirement-through-scenario-analysis/#comments">42 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-34654" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hawaiian-sunset-300x254.png?0c052b" alt="Early Retirement Hawaiian Sunset" width="300" height="254" />Early retirement is fantastic. There&#8217;s only one problem. Most early retirees no longer contribute to their 401Ks unless they start a business. Not only that, early retirees lose employer 401K match and profit sharing. I just took a look at my final year&#8217;s employer 401K profit sharing plus match and it came out to $27,000. There&#8217;s much more to your job than just your salary!</p><p>My 401K makes up a minority portion of my stock exposure as I&#8217;ve been aggressively investing through structured notes and after-tax accounts. Furthermore, I&#8217;ve been receiving more deferred company stock than desired. Although $400,000 is not a lot to retire on, it&#8217;s the best I could do after maxing out for 13 years after college. It should serve well for illustrative purposes to see how a portfolio can grow under different assumptions.</p><p>With the way the government loves to spend our money, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the retirement age for distribution without penalty increases beyond 59.5 or the government imposes a &#8220;distribution tax&#8221; to take more of our money. That said, we can hope for the best by <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2012/12/16/how-to-reduce-401k-fees-through-portfolio-analysis/" target="_blank">reducing our mutual fund expenses</a> and creating different scenarios to better prepare for our future.</p><p>The best way to increasing our odds for retirement success is to run various investment scenarios. I will run three investment scenarios (Conservative, Realistic, Blue Sky) using the free 401K investment analyzer by <a href="http://personalcapital.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=4&amp;aff_id=1002&amp;aff_sub=BetterManage401K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Personal Capital</a>. Regardless of whether you are retired or not, I encourage everybody to perform at least these three scenarios and write down some notes. Early retirees need to be extra diligent given we are more dependent on our investments to survive. If you have years to go before retirement, I suggest you pretend you are retired now so you can develop a fire to be all over your money!</p><h2><span style="color: #000000;">CONSERVATIVE 401K PORTFOLIO SCENARIO</span></p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-better-manage-your-401k-for-retirement-through-scenario-analysis/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></h2></div></article><article class="post-26489 post type-post status-publish format-standard sticky category-investments category-most-popular category-retirement entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-average-net-worth-for-the-above-average-person/" rel="bookmark">The Average Net Worth For The Above Average Person</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-average-net-worth-for-the-above-average-person/#comments">558 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2012/05/14/the-average-net-worth-for-the-above-average-person/big-pumelos/" rel="attachment wp-att-26507"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-46150" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/massive-yacht-350x220.png?0c052b" alt="The average net worth for the above average person is large" width="350" height="220" /></a>Everything is relative when it comes to money.  If we all earn $1 million dollars a year and have $5 million in the bank at the age of 40, none of us are very wealthy given all our costs (housing, food, transportation, vacations) will be priced at levels that squeeze us to the very end.  As such, we must first get an idea of what the real average net worth is in our respective countries, and then figure out the average net worth of the above average person!</p><p>According to CNN Money 2014, the average net worth for the following ages are: $9,000 for ages 25-34,  $52,000 for ages 35-44, $100,000 for ages 45-54, $180,000 for ages 55-64, and $232,000+ for 65+. Seems very low, but that&#8217;s because we use averages and a large age range.</p><p>After a 13% rise in the S&amp;P 500 in 2014, surely the average net worth has increased even further for 2015.</p><h2><strong>The Above Average Person is loosely defined as:</strong></h2><p>1) Someone who went to college and believes grades and a good work ethic do matter.</p><p>2) Does not irrationally spend more than they make.</p><p>3) Saves for the future because they realize at some point they no longer are willing or able to work.</p><p>4) Takes responsibility for their own actions when things go wrong and learns from the situation to make things better.</p><p>5) Takes action by <a href="http://personalcapital.go2cloud.org/SHS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">leveraging free tools on the internet</a> to track their net worth, minimize investment fees, manage their budget, and stay on top of their finances in general. Once you know where all your money is, it becomes much easier to optimize your wealth and make it grow.</p><p>6) Welcomes constructive criticism and is not overly sensitive from friends, loved ones, and strangers in order to keep improving. Keeping an open mind is critical.</p><p>7) Has a healthy amount of self-esteem to be able to lead change and believe in themselves.</p><p>8) Enjoys empowering themselves through learning, whether it be through books, personal finance blogs, magazines, seminars, continuing education and so forth.</p><p>9) Has little-to-no student loan debt due to scholarships, part-time work, or help from their parents.

The worst is the IRA which limits you to contributing only $5,500 only for individuals making under $60,000 a year and married couples making under $116,000 a year. Meanwhile, you have to make less than $114,000 a year as a single or $181,000 as a married couple for the privilege of contributing after tax dollars to a <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/2012/03/29/disadvantages-of-the-roth-ira-not-all-is-what-it-seems/" target="_blank">Roth IRA</a>, which I do not recommend before maxing out your 401k.</p><p>Give me a pension that pays 70% of my last year&#8217;s salary for the rest of my life over a 401(k) any time! With the government only allowing individuals to contribute $17,500 a year in pre-tax income into their 401ks in 2014, once again, our politicians fail us with their regulations.</p><p>The average 401k balance as of January 2014 is around $99,000 thanks to an incredible 30% rise in the S&amp;P 500 in 2013. Let&#8217;s add another 13% increase for 2015 given the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s performance and we&#8217;re at roughly $112,500. Even so, $112,500 is incredibly low given the median age of an American is 36.5. As an educated reader who is logical and believes saving for retirement is a must, I&#8217;ve proposed a table that shows how much each person should have saved in their 401ks at age 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65.</p><p>We stop at 65 because you are allowed to start withdrawing penalty free from your 401k at age 59 1/2. Meanwhile, I pray to goodness you don&#8217;t have to work much past 65 because you&#8217;ve had 40 years to save and investment already!</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-should-one-have-in-their-401k-at-different-ages/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><article class="post-49046 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-career category-motivation entry" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><header class="entry-header"><h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/welfare-to-well-off-financial-independence-journey/" rel="bookmark">From Welfare to Well-Off: My Journey To Financial Independence</a></h2><p class="entry-meta">Posted by <span class="entry-author" itemprop="author" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/author/admin/" class="entry-author-link" itemprop="url" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name" itemprop="name">Financial Samurai</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/welfare-to-well-off-financial-independence-journey/#comments">59 Comments</a></span></p></header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-49302" src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/financial-journey-by-melfoody-Flickr-CC-350x232.jpg?0c052b" alt="The journey to financial independence" width="350" height="232" />The following is a guest post by Samurai Dominic. He shares his story about escaping the life of trouble and poverty towards one day reaching financial independence. Reading different perspectives is what makes the Financial Samurai community so awesome. &#8211; Sam<br /> </em></p><p>They say the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. You know when the second best time is? TODAY!</p><p>As you are about to discover, it doesn’t matter where you start in life, what matters is how you play the hand you were dealt. You can stand around and <a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/are-there-really-people-who-only-work-40-hours-a-week-or-less/" target="_blank">complain how the world is unfair</a>, and yes it is very unfair…get over it. Complaining and dwelling on your dire circumstances will do nothing to improve your life, so don’t waste your time. The thing to remember is that successful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.</p><p>We live in unprecedented times with more opportunity than any other time in history. You just have to decide if you are willing to put in the work to achieve your vision of success.</p><p>You could say I am one of those rags to riches stories in the making. I entered this world like most, in a hospital room naked and screaming. However, I entered the world with absolutely no advantage. Some might say I was dealt a crap hand. I grew up in a low income area, where my family and most other families were on welfare or some kind of government support. Growing up I slept on the hard-floor of my grandmother’s 2-bedroom apartment with my 3 brothers, while my grandmother and mom shared a bed, and my uncle had the other room.</p><p>Shit, we were so poor that my grandmother would use the oven to heat the apartment (not cooking for, but cracking the oven door while it was on with nothing in it). That could not have been safe. And to this day I don’t really know if it was actually cheaper to heat the apartment using the oven vs. the actual heating unit. Either way my grandmother was determined it was the best and cheapest way to heat the house.</p><div style="text-align:center;" class="readmore"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/welfare-to-well-off-financial-independence-journey/" rel="nofollow"><strong><br /><h4>Read More&#8230;</h4><p></strong></a></div></div></article><div class="archive-pagination pagination"><ul><li class="active"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/">1</a></li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/page/2/">2</a></li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/page/3/">3</a></li><li class="pagination-omission">&#x02026;</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/page/145/">145</a></li><li class="pagination-next"><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/page/2/" >Next Page&#x000BB;</a></li></ul></div> </main><aside class="sidebar sidebar-primary widget-area" role="complementary" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/WPSideBar"><section id="simple-social-icons-4" class="widget simple-social-icons"><div class="widget-wrap"><ul class="aligncenter"><li class="social-email"><a href="http://forms.aweber.com/form/61/638448361.htm" target="_blank">&#xe80b;</a></li><li class="social-rss"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FinancialSamurai" target="_blank">&#xe805;</a></li><li class="social-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/financialsamura" target="_blank">&#xe80d;</a></li></ul></div></section><section id="text-93" class="widget widget_text"><div class="widget-wrap"><div class="textwidget"><center><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-make-money-quitting-your-job/" target="_blank"><img src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/new-300x250.png?0c052b" alt="How To Make Money Quitting Your Job"/></a></center></div></div></section><section id="text-57" class="widget widget_text"><div class="widget-wrap"><div class="textwidget"><center><div id="ratebrainWidget"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ratebrain.com/fs-widget-300x250.js"></script></center></div></div></section><section id="text-111" class="widget widget_text"><div class="widget-wrap"><div class="textwidget"><center><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/about/" target="_blank"><img src="http://cdn.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AsFeaturedIn-v10.png?0c052b" alt="Where Financial Samurai Has Been Featured"/></a></center></div></div></section><section id="text-131" class="widget widget_text"><div class="widget-wrap"><div class="textwidget"><center><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ap.lijit.com///www/delivery/fpi.js?z=147904&u=yakezie&width=160&height=600"></script></center></div></div></section><section id="most_popular_posts-5" class="widget widget_most_popular_posts"><div class="widget-wrap"><h4 class="widget-title widgettitle">Most Commented Posts</h4><ul><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-money-do-the-top-income-earners-make-percent/">How Much Money Do The Top Income Earners Make?</a> (1159)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/creating-powerful-friends-the-alexa-ranking-challenge/">Creating Powerful Friends: Samurai's Alexa Ranking Challenge</a> (730)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/how-much-should-one-have-in-their-401k-at-different-ages/">How Much Should People Have Saved In Their 401Ks At Different Ages</a> (666)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-average-net-worth-for-the-above-average-person/">The Average Net Worth For The Above Average Person</a> (558)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-110th-rule-for-car-buying-everyone-must-follow/">The 1/10th Rule For Car Buying Everyone Must Follow</a> (554)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/disadvantages-of-the-roth-ira-not-all-is-what-it-seems/">Disadvantages Of The ROTH IRA: Not All Is What It Seems</a> (391)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/are-there-really-people-who-only-work-40-hours-a-week-or-less/">Are There Really People Who Only Work 40 Hours A Week Or Less And Complain Why They Can't Get Ahead?</a> (311)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/the-dark-side-of-early-retirement-risks-dangers/">The Dark Side Of Early Retirement</a> (265)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/renters-should-pay-more-taxes/">Renters Should Pay More Taxes</a> (250)</li><li><a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/were-idiots-please-tell-us-a-flat-tax-is-not-fair/">We're Ignorant Idiots!
