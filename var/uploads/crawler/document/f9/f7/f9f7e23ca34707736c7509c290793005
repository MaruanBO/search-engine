          <p><h4>Download Manager - More Information</h4><p>We use download managers to manage all of the downloads offered on our website. When users click download on any of our pages, a download manager will be downloaded to the user's computer, that will then allow the user to download the primary software direct from manufacturer or public urls. In the download manager, users may be presented with offers for 3rd party software. If users accept the offer, the offered software will be downloaded and installed while the download manager is running. All offers are completely optional and users may decline all offers and still continue to download the primary software unimpeded. After offers have been presented and installed (if accepted), the primary software will begin to download from the manufacturer's urls or other public url to the user's computer. When the download is complete, the download manager may give users the option to open the folder that the software was downloaded to, or to launch (through a standard windows launch command - same as double-clicking) the downloaded software's installer. The download manager closes completely thereafter, and does not modify or interfere in any way with the primary software's installer.</p><p>We use these download managers in order to help pay for for the creation, maintenance, and upkeep of this website, and to keep our website mostly ad-free. Whereas most download sites use many confusing ads on their webpages in order to help pay the bills, we think showing a few offers in the download manager is a better experience. If you'd like to support us, please accept an offer in the download manager. But please read the offers first, and make sure you will enjoy the offered software.</p><p>All offers on our site and in download managers connected with our site are fully optional. You can decline any or all offers and we will still provide our download services. But the more users accept offers, the more free software we can offer in the future.</p><p>Examples of offers in our download managers:</p><img src="//content.downloadnet.org/common/images/example_offers.png" ></p>
