                        <b><span class="txtBlk">'Welcome To The Future'</span></b> -  American business magnate, investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet does not let his age affect any of his decision making or business solutions. Instead, he relies on a lesser known &quot;secret&quot; to aid him where he is now today.

The secret? A brain pill. Other business moguls such as Bill Gates and Mark Cuban admitted to using this product to help keep their minds intact. We're not saying you can be rich like these guys instantly, but it will enhance your memory, critical thinking, analyzing/interpreting ability, and creation of new ideas, which will lead you to the right path of success. It's called <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b> (<em>medical name: E-Huperzine</em>) and the results are more than enough to give the latest superheroes a run for their money.

                        There's already been previous controversy  around the memory-enhancing pill which was the inspiration for the movie Limitless. Heavily praised by Gary Stix as 'the missing link in human evolution' in his report <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/turbocharging-the-brain/" target="_blank">'</a><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/turbocharging-the-brain/" target="_blank">Turbo-charging the Brain', </a>when released, the use of <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b> became widespread amongst young professionals. Specifically, men aged between 25-40 benefited the most as the effects were amplified due to the ingredients&rsquo; reaction to a gene called NRXN3 in the male brain. Men reported having <strong>'laser beam focus' </strong>and were <strong>thinking sharper, improving their memory</strong> and <strong>turbo charging their energy levels</strong>. Even more appealing and controversial was how the pills helped men effortlessly attract and seduce beautiful women with their new found quick wit and charm.

                        <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b> soon became known as the &lsquo;most powerful self-development trick on earth&rsquo;. Not long after, everyone from quiz show contestants to university students were taking the pill to <strong>double their IQ</strong>, <strong>triple their salary</strong> and <strong>achieve peak performance</strong> in little time. <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b>, which has no recorded side effects in any trials, was soon the target of several major pharmaceutical companies who claimed it gave people an unfair advantage over anyone who was unaware of its existence. The pill was eventually banned on shows like Jeopardy! and at top universities such as Cambridge before production of the limitless pills were halted.        <strong></strong>

                        After several years and over 2000 trials at The Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU), Brain Storm Elite pills are back in production and recent reports are proving the superhero making drug is more powerful then ever. The secret to pill's improved formula? Bee pollen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you read that right: Bee pollen has been praised for its ability to rejuvenate and heal the mind for centuries. Combining this with the already powerful ingredients of <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b>, and your mind will be clearer then that of a Zen-monk&rsquo;s. Your ability to focus and power through your to-do list will also be a thing of the past and after consistent use, you will <strong>become the perfect version of yourself.</strong> Many people thought something like this wouldn&rsquo;t exist for another hundred years but as Dr Raqif said: <a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">welcome to the future</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Critics of the pill are of course making their voices heard and if the effectiveness of Brain Storm Elite is stronger then it previously was then these will not be around much longer. With such a powerful opportunity to lower your stress levels, master your emotions and triple your salary, it's only a matter of time before <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b> pills are once again the target of major pharmaceutical companies who are seeing a  decline in their profit.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        With so much media praise and countless reviews of people experiencing success with <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b>, The Discover Magazine wanted to verify whether this was all hype. After almost every single man in the building volunteered to test it out but we chose our Senior Chief Editor Alan Frasier. Below is his account of using <b><a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">Brain Storm Elite</a></b> over a 4 week period.

                        Summary of Alan’s Brain Storm Elite pills experience
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The Brain Storm Elite pills were extremely hard to come by. We had to wait 2 weeks before we got a bottle to test as it was sold out almost everywhere or over $300 a bottle from people trying to sell it for profit ebay. People were paying top dollar for them on there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first impressions were the packaging of the pills didn’t match what I have been hearing. With the picture of the brain and Brain Storm Elite written in red, the bottle looked a bit too party pill style. But I took one and forgot about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe 20-30 minutes later I felt odd. I can only describe it by saying my mind felt calm and still. It was like that feeling you get when you have just woken up. Light headed so to speak but this was different. I was light headed and spaced out but in the zone at the same time. Can’t explain it - but it was awesome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of the 4 weeks I found myself bouncing out of bed and felt ready to take on the day - usually I need to snooze 3 times. I felt motivation to get stuff done and often power through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thing’s that annoyed me were no longer an issue.<strong> I hardly got stressed</strong> and when I did, I was able to control my emotions and get back into peak performance and state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My thoughts on Brain Storm Elite are that, despite the horrible look of the bottle (we have been joking about it a lot in the office)<strong> the pills are the real deal</strong>. I’ve tried modafinil and other smart drugs but this is by far the closest thing to feeling like you are Bradley Cooper from Limitless. Since then 90% of us have reoccurring subscriptions to make sure we never run out as I hear <a href="http://www.brainstormelite.com/ss1/index.php" target="_blank">very few people can get a hold of these.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you happen to come across these, you can move on with your day and go about your life or you can spare 2 minutes and take what is <strong>the most important step to becoming the man you want to be</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Should Brain Storm Elite be legal?</h1>
                    <p>
                        When Brain Storm Elite was originally banned a lot of people were angry. There were no side effects then and as it stands there are no side effects with the stronger formula. Here are clinical studies of the main ingredients in this product (<a href="http://www.ajpcr.com/Vol4Suppl1/496.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Study #1</a>, <a href="http://www.balazs-gulyas.hu/files/67_Vas_vinpocetine_2002.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Study #2</a>). That said, all our users followed the directions and did not go overboard so it’s strongly recommended to use common sense when taking these.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brain Storm Elite is the only pill of it’s kind where the user benefits and grows the more he takes. Normally the body gets used to most medications but throughout all trials all users made continued progress as the weeks went on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regards to whether these should be legal? Yes they should. In fact, they never should have been banned. The truth is the ‘health and safety’ of the product was never a concern. Major competing companies created uproar due to their heavily sinking profits when Brain Storm Elite was becoming widely used. Even more companies are joining in this time so we have no doubt that production of Brain Storm Elite pills will be stopped once again.

                        <p>
                            The first day of taking Brain Storm Elite was an experience in itself. I started to feel a sense of calm after about 15 minutes. 30 Minutes later I had what felt like 360 degrees vision. My mind was clear and calm. Nothing like coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After one week of using Brain Storm Elite my energy levels are up, and it's not like a typical coffee rush. This is a smooth boost of long-lasting, natural energy without the crash… I love it! My brain honestly felt CLEAR for the first time in years, and this was just after a few short days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I woke up today (day 7) feeling like a new and improved me. I had one of the most productive weeks I could remember and  felt like I owed it all to this tiny pill. But I was still a little skeptical. To be honest, i'm still a little skeptical. If this week wasn't a fluke things are definitely looking up for me But I am reserving judgement.
                        </p>
                        <span class="resultsSub">

                        </span>
                        <p>
                            After two weeks of using Brain Storm Elite, I'm feeling even more focused and energized than before. Today I had what I would have called a "long day" and it hasn't even bothered me! I'm more focused right now (after a 10hr work day) than I would normally be waking up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm bouncing out of bed. I wake up earlier without an alarm. It's great. I always woke up lethargic and like a zombie. Thinking about it now, that hasnt happened once. I literally wake up and i'm ready to take on the day. It's a truly unique experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My focus and concentration is pretty damn good. But I found I need to set alarms otherwise it is very easy to get carried away. Yesterday I want meant to meet some friends but was so absorbed in work. Good thing for focus. But alarms are a must.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My stress levels also seem down. Not sure if this is unrelated as I haven't been as stressed since I started this. So not sure if it is because of the pill that I am not stressed or not.
                        </p>
                        <span class="resultsSub"><img src="images/bulletCheck.png" style="border:none !important;">Week Three</span>
                        <p>
                            I looked back on my results at the end of this week and realised that this is the read deal! Well done. I am very happy right now. Haven't stopped smilling. I'm just always on. I'm always in control. Yesterday at work we had a major project deadline we weren't going to hit and I was the only one who was in control out of the entire team. Including my boss. I literally feel like I am mastering my emotions. I'm still experiencing a climb in focus and my memory is sharper than ever too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around the third week of using any supplement, I would expect to run out of steam due to the body getting used to the ingredients. But my energy levels haven't dipped at all. They remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3 p.m. in the afternoon!
                        </p>
                        <span class="resultsSub">
                            <img src="images/bulletCheck.png" style="border:none !important;">Week Four
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            After the fourth week, my final results were amazing. My memory is crystal-clear, and my levels of focus and concentration have been through the roof!  Even though my test is over, with the results I've experienced over the last month I am obviously going to continue taking Brain Storm Elite if possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Side effects wise: none but you need to set an alarm to remind yourself of other work that needs to be done. You could get wrapped up in a passion project very easily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love this stuff. I have no stress these days, I sleep less, wake up ready and energised and as for the brain games I have been playing...my scores have tripled which is awesome! love seeing the graph and how it shows my IQ has sky rocketed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hands down, the best decision I made was ordering a bottle. I plan to use these for the rest of my life is possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise I would feel like a God who lost his powers!</p>
                        <p>
                            Ok that's a bit dramatic but the point is, these are great. Well done once again.

                                <p>I saw this on a lot on the news about that student who took it and got blamed for cheating caus eit gave him a edge over everyone else? terrible. I tried one from my mate and i'll admit, it's the best thing i've had for focus and clarity but i never felt out of control or like i was a different person or anything? the media just want to create panic for nothing!</p>

                                <p> There is a big stir going on these days about Brain Storm Elite and my guess is it's not going to stop. I am seeing Brain Storm Elite all over.. they were giving out free samples at the mall today and the stand sure did have a crowd. Thanks to the special offer you posted I saved over $112. Thanks for the links Doc! </p>

My best friend James was swearing this stuff was the best thing since sliced bread.. i couldn't believe it and had to do some research on my own which is how I found this news article. I can't believe they are offering it this cheap! I know James spent something like $600 and was thrilled.. This is a unreal, thanks so much guys!! </p>

                                <p> stand by this pill. I tried Brain Storm Elite about a month ago and I can't say enough about it. This helped me gain an edge in life i felt like i had lost forever. It completely brought back joy in my life. (I have been waiting for something like this for a long time). I highly recommend this to ANYONE that's looking for a product that actually WORKS. </p>

Love it. Thank you. I've had trouble with losing concentration since middle school, so you can imagine how desperate I was to finally feel as great as my friends seemed to every day. I finally tried Brain Storm Elite, and let me tell you, I will NEVER try another thing again! This stuff is incredible! For the first time I feel like I'm capable of anything! Thank you so much!"

I've had a busy lifestyle ever since I started having a family due to having no time, but no matter how hard I tried there was just never enough time to get things done.
