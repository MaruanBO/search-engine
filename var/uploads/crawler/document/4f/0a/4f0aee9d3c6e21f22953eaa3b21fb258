<h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;color:#333;margin-right:-20px;font-size:33px;">5 Steps To Looking 10 Years Younger</h2>

<h4 style="color:#333;"><em>By Steve & Becky Holman</em></h4>

<p>Did you know that once you hit 40 years of age, whether you're a man or a women, your body starts aging FASTER than normal? Studies have shown that without the proper nutrients and exercise, your body will age about 6 months EXTRA for every year that passes. Think about that! If you are 40, that means by the time you hit 44 you will LOOK and FEEL 48. And by the time you reach 60, you will LOOK and FEEL 70 YEARS OLD! We see this every day... just look around you.</p>

<p>Did you know that 90% of people over the age of 35 lose enough muscle every year to burn off an additional 4 pounds of body fat? That means you not only lose the only thing on your body that creates shape, tone, and strength—you also gain more fat every year, <strong>even if your calories stay the same</strong>.</p>

<p>Did you know that <strong>all of this is reversible at any age?</strong> That there are specific ways to move, eat, and think that tell your brain to STOP this rapid aging process... and even SLOW IT DOWN to the point where you're aging less than a year for every year? That means you can look younger at 40 than you do at 35... or if you're like Becky and I, younger at 50+ than we did at 40!</p>

<p>This is not fantasy talk. This does not require a boatload of anti-aging drugs, supplements, or gimmicks. And, this works for anyone, male or female, and works at any age. 35, 45, 55, 65, 75... you name it. The biology is exactly the same.</p>

<p>My years as editor-in-chief at <em>Iron Man</em> Magazine have allowed me to peer into the <strong>secret routines of the anti-aging experts</strong>. Over the years, both Becky and I have picked up SO many tips, tricks, and strategies that have allowed us to literally <strong>reverse the aging process</strong>, at least from a cellular level. That means our body's look, feel, and MOVE younger than our chronological age.</p>

<p>We've taught this System to countless men and women over the years, and it always begins with these <strong>5 key principles you must apply</strong> in order to STOP the rapid onset of aging that's going on right now, reverse it, and begin "aging backwards" by restoring your body's natural youth hormones.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>we have to warn you:</strong> What you are about to hear may go against all the conventional diet and exercise advice you've been hearing. That's because the world has, to be utterly frank, <strong>gone soft!</strong> "Core training", hot yoga, spin classes, tai chí all of these are just fine, but they won't slow your aging, and they certainly will never shape your muscles or burn off stubborn body fat. No way!</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;margin-top:45px;margin-bottom:45px;font-size:28px;line-height:34px;">These 5 steps reveal the things <span class="highlight">you absolutely MUST AVOID</span> if you want to slow the aging process, reclaim your health, and achieve your ideal body.</h4>

<p>What you need is a splash of cold water, a touch of Old School, and the honest truth. Sound good? Let's dive in!</p>

<h3>Step 1: Forget Low-Fat Diets</h3>

<p><img align="left" alt="Forget Low Fat!" height="160" src="http://cdn.oldschoolnewbody.com/images/salad.jpg" style="padding:2px;border:1px solid #ccc;margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" width="213" />Low fat <u>everything</u> has been the craze now for decades and look around. What has that wonderful bit of advice done for the bodies you see? We're fatter, sicker, and more addicted to sugar and carbs than any other time in history. <strong>And, we're passing these habits to our kids.</strong></p>

<p>Fats are not to be feared – they're to be embraced. They do not make you fat; rather, they help your body <strong>regenerate your power hormones</strong>. Testosterone, the 'strength' hormone, for example, is the direct result of <em>cholesterol and dietary fat intake</em>. That's right: "Cholesterol" isn't a dirty word! Your body needs dietary fat and cholesterol in order to produce ANY AND ALL vital hormones.</p>

<p>People on low fat diets look drawn, gaunt, and weak. They are often sick, sometimes to the point of literally breaking down. And, they can never just <strong>enjoy eating out</strong>. Every meal and every gram must be accounted for. Do you really think this will make you <em>younger</em>? Of course not... it will worry you to death if it doesn't kill you first!</p>
