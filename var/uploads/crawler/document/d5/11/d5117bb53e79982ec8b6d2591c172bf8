      <h3 align="left"><strong>Java Key Features</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Java is a high-level programming language and a runtime environment for computers. The actual software comes with a number of libraries and executable files that can do everything from running an application written in Java to compiling human readable source code into special bytecode files. Java is distinctive because it is designed to allow for seamless cross-platform program execution. This means Java applications or apps can technically be run on any system with the Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, installed. There are a few versions of Java available today. The most popular is the JRE. This is intended for average end-users. There is also the Java Development Kit, or JDK, intended for developers.</p>
      <p>The JRE generally has two components. The first is the basic Java libraries, executables and runtime environment. The libraries allow Java to access the native functions of the underlying operating system directly. The runtime environment is a series of executable files that create a virtual sandbox containing everything needed to run Java applications. If Java is installed properly, then it can run programs written in the language automatically just like natively compiled applications.</p>
      <p>Another element of Java is a browser plug-in. Java has plug-ins available for the most popular browsers today. The plug-in allows Java apps embedded in websites to be run from within the browser. Java apps are used for everything from basic animations or complex calculators and advanced games. The plug-in portion of Java bridges the gap between the browser and the native libraries installed on the computer.</p>
      <p>The JDK includes a number of additional tools that are specifically geared towards programmers and developers. It includes a command-line compiler. It also has tool to help debug programs and to automatically generate technical documentation for classes. The JDK is not needed for people who are not programmers. It is important to note that no graphical user interfaces are included in the JDK. Most developers use an integrated development environment, or IDE, to access the tools in the package.</p>
      <p>Java is known for having tight security for applications run in the JRE. Typical web-based Java apps and even desktop applications cannot directly access the hard drive or other hardware on a computer without express permission from the owner. Java as a programming language is popular because it is simple to learn and includes many utility classes that make writing boilerplate code for networking or interface elements unnecessary.</p>
      <p>Java is a popular piece of software today. It is installed on many computers and other devices. The JRE and JDK are updated constantly to add new features, repair bugs and enhance performance. Java software is an integral part of computers and the web today.</p>
