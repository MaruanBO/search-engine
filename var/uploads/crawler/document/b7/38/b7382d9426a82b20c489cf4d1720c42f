<p>Finally, after many weeks of development and seven pre-releases, Minecraft 1.8.2 is ready for release. It is now available in the Minecraft launcher and the server can be downloaded from <a href="https://minecraft.net/download">the Minecraft website download page</a>.</p>
<p>Only minor changes were made since pre-release 7 which was available since Monday. Version 1.8.2 is also fully compatible with all previous server versions (1.8 and 1.8.1), but we recommend to update to 1.8.2 as soon as possible to benefit from all bug fixes and improvements we made in the game.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time again to announce the next MINECON!</p>
<p>If you like Minecraft, and you like people who like Minecraft, you&#8217;ll probably like MINECON. It&#8217;s THE place to see all the cool Mojangstas you fancy, meet people who love Minecraft maybe even as much as you do, and attend panels and events full of YouTube creators and a ton of other talented folks!</p>
<p>This summer we are heading to London, UK to hang out with 10,000 of our closest friends (hint: that&#8217;s you!). As usual there will be panels, contests, tournaments, events and a soon-to-be-announced show-of-some-sort for our Saturday night bash.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> July 4-5, 2015</p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> ExCeL London Exhibition and Conference Centre</p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong> You, hopefully!</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re bound to have more questions, I&#8217;ll ask myself some in this handy Q&#038;A:</p>
<p><strong>How do I get tickets?</strong><br />
Ticket sales will happen in February, exact date and time will be announced in the next two weeks. You&#8217;ll head to minecon.mojang.com to purchase them, but they will go fast! To accommodate different people&#8217;s schedules, they will be released in two batches on the same day, different times, 5,000 tickets in each batch. When you buy your ticket you&#8217;ll also get access to our discounted hotel pricing, so don&#8217;t go booking a hotel room just yet!</p>
<p><strong>How do I become a volunteer (aka MINECON Agent)?</strong><br />
So you want to be a part of the event? We will be taking volunteer submissions next week. You&#8217;ll fill out an online form and we will get back to you before tickets go on sale. Watch mojang.com for more details.</p>
<p><strong>I have a great idea for a panel, how can I make it happen?</strong><br />
Our community submitted panels have been some of the best panels we&#8217;ve had! Panel submissions will begin in early March. You&#8217;ll need to fill out an online form about the panel, who would be best on it, and submit a video of yourself describing the panel and why it should be at MINECON.</p>
<p><strong>I want to exhibit at MINECON. How do I get a booth?</strong><br />
Each year we have a nice selection of awesome exhibitors, and you could be one of them! You can contact us via minecon@mojang.com for exhibition booth requests.</p>
<p>More details and information will be coming in the next couple weeks, keep watching mojang.com for all the answers you seek!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!<br />

<p>Hey! Remember the Humble Card Game Bundle we <a href="https://mojang.com/2015/01/hey-you-buy-the-humble-card-game-bundle/">mentioned last week</a>? It just got even better! Now, if you pay over the average you get the two snazzy Scrolls avatar heads you can see up there, along with a bunch of other cool stuff.</p>
<p>Not too shabby. For more info, check out the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrolls/comments/2t6tg9/humble_bundle_faq/">Scrolls Humble Bundle FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with the way Minecraft servers work, but lots of you aren’t. We’d like to fix that. </p>
<p>Put simply, servers give Minecraft players the opportunity to play together online.</p>
<p><b>There are many different types of servers, and we love almost all of them</b><br />
Apart from <a href="https://minecraft.net/realms">Minecraft Realms</a> (which is another way for players to enjoy a persistent world with friends), no servers are owned or run by us. They are independent and set up by many different types of people for many different reasons. Some are set up by fans of the game so they can play with their friends and family, some are created to make money, some are weird social experiments that we don&#8217;t really understand.</p>
<p>Many third-party Minecraft servers give our players innovative and interesting ways to play. And we’re thankful that they exist. Without them, Minecraft wouldn&#8217;t be as successful or diverse as it is today.</p>
<p><b>We&#8217;re not responsible for the way servers are operated</b><br />
Having freedom to create awesome things and express yourself without boundaries is one of the things that makes Minecraft so great, but it can lead to content that some may deem inappropriate, or in people doing things we&#8217;re not too keen on. We&#8217;re not responsible for the content on third party servers.</p>
<p>These sites and servers are not run or governed by us and so long as they abide to our EULA and terms of use, we don&#8217;t have control over them. It’s a bit like YouTube &#8211; a video might be about Minecraft, but we don&#8217;t agree with everything that’s said in every upload. We&#8217;ve watched enough of them to understand how silly that would be.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also not responsible for the way these servers take payments or store users’ credentials online. Just like making a purchase anywhere on the internet, it’s extremely important that you trust whoever you&#8217;re dealing with (in this case, a server host) before you hand over personal details or credit card information.</p>
<p><b>The internet can be a crazy place</b><br />
It’s the responsibility of individual users or (in many cases) their parents / guardians, to track what Minecraft content is appropriate for specific users. That said, unmodded Minecraft for PC/Mac, the console versions, and Minecraft: Realms are our responsibility. We do our best to provide a safe, secure experience and keep things as fun as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Have you been hacked? What&#8217;s going on, Moj?</strong><br />
No! We haven’t been hacked. A bunch of bad people have tricked some of our users into disclosing their account information. We’ve emailed everyone affected, and reset all compromised passwords. If you haven&#8217;t received an email from us, you don’t need to worry.</p>
<p>No-one has gained access to the Mojang mainframe. Even if they did, we store your passwords in a super encrypted format. Honestly, you don’t need to panic.</p>
<p><strong>So how did they get the info? You were hacked, weren’t you?</strong><br />
No &#8211; we weren’t hacked. The bad people got their hands on other people’s passwords by using an evil technique called “phishing.” That basically means they pretend to be Mojang and fool people into entering their private details onto fake websites.</p>
<p><strong>What can I learn from this?</strong><br />
You should never, ever, enter your Mojang account details on websites that aren’t owned by us. It’s good practice to use different passwords for each of your internet logins too. That way, if someone does get hold of one password, they won’t get access to your other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>I’d still like to reset my Mojang password. Just to be safe</strong><br />
Fair enough. You sound like a sensible one. Here’s a link: <a href="https://minecraft.net/resetpassword">minecraft.net/resetpassword</a>. If you have any other support issues, <a href="https://help.mojang.com/">help.mojang.com</a> is your friend.</p>

<p>Everyone likes big numbers, right? I know I do. Here’s a stonker: 30,000,000! You good people have bought Minecraft: Pocket Edition over 30 million times. Thanks!</p>
<p>To celebrate the sales milestone, we&#8217;re planning a question and answer session with the devs. It will be broadcast LIVE on the internet. And you get to supply the questions.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: you can watch it below! Yes, the footage looks like it was streamed from a worn-out VHS and edited by a chump. Why? Because it was! We&#8217;re cool like that.</strong></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NiBgKbRfjlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Hit this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2s6h7g/the_official_pocket_edition_question_thread/">reddit thread</a> and submit your query. We&#8217;ll pick the top-voted/least offensive ones and put them to the devs LIVE on air later this week. It&#8217;s going to be great. Get involved!</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true! In the near future you will be able to change your Minecraft in-game name.</p>
<p><strong>When? When! When?!</strong><br />
We plan to make name changing available on February 4th.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do this? Will it cost money?</strong><br />
The only thing you need is a Mojang account. If you currently sign in to Minecraft with an email address, you&#8217;re all good! Otherwise, you can migrate your old Minecraft account <a href="https://account.mojang.com/migrate">here</a>. There are no other requirements, and it doesn&#8217;t cost any money.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds good! Where can I do it?</strong><br />
Just <a href="https://account.mojang.com/me">head on over to your Mojang account page</a>! Once the feature is made available you&#8217;ll see a &#8220;change&#8221; link next to your Minecraft name.</p>
<p><strong>Can I steal somebody’s name? Can I call myself “Dinnerbone” too?</strong><br />
No. There is already somebody called Dinnerbone and names are still unique. You can&#8217;t have the same name as another player; they will have to change their name for you to be able to take it. 37 days after they change their name, the old one will become available.</p>
<p><strong>What about all those unpaid usernames from so many years ago?</strong><br />
We will be freeing up all those old unpaid usernames when the new name changing feature is released. If you have an old unpaid name that you&#8217;d like to keep, there&#8217;s still time to buy it! <a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/1726864-buying-an-old-minecraft-username?b_id=5408">Read this help article</a> to learn how.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change the capitalisation of my name?</strong><br />
Yes, you can!</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean that I can pick a new name every day?</strong><br />
No. After changing your name you have to wait 30 days before you can do it again.</p>
<p><strong>What if I change my name and then realise that I don&#8217;t like it? Can I change back to my old name?<br />
</strong>Yes, you can. You still have to wait the 30 days though.</p>
<p><strong>If I ban a player “Foo” and he changes name to “Bar”, will he stay banned?</strong><br />
Yes. Same for whitelisted players and oped players. They also keep their inventory, pets, statistics and everything they own on a server.</p>
<p><strong>How will this work with mods? What about my custom stuff on this one modded server?</strong><br />
Ask your mod maker/server owner. Mods should be able to support this system easily and most already do, but we aren&#8217;t responsible for mods or servers!</p>
<p><strong>Can I have a hug?</strong><br />
*hugs*</p>
