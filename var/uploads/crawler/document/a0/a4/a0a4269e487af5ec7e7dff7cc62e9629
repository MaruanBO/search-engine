        	<h2>Probably The Most Profitable Way To Make Money Online, But Less Than 0.5% Of The World's Population Knows It Exists</h2>

            <p><span class="firstcharacter">E</span>veryone wants to make money from home - regardless of whether they have a day job or not. And today, the possibilities are endless thanks to the Internet. I can remember back around 1996, when the web was still in its infancy.</p>
			<p>I kept telling to myself and those around me: "One day, this web thing is going to change the definition of 'opportunities' for the everyday person." And it has - big time.</p>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <h3>What's the real problem?</h3>
            <hr class="dot-line">
            <p>With technology comes opportunity, but it also brings problems - and one of the main problems has always been the fact that many people are not technologically oriented.</p> 

			<p>Most "make money online" opportunities are based on establishing and operating a website. For some, that's the easiest thing in the world. For most, however, it's the hardest. After talking to literally hundreds of people, this has show itself to be the number one reason people never make it online.</p>

			<p>But it doesn't have to be that way, because the web is not just about websites - far from it. The web has evolved and can now connect people with so many other types of great income opportunities... especially ones were understanding technology is unnecessary.</p> 

        	<p>However, these alternate opportunities are also particularly relevant to people possessing the necessary technological abilities, but have no time to spend building an online business... people looking to use the Internet for making money, without needing to commit time they don't have.</p>
            <h3>The solution? - a little-known niche that has really proven itself</h3>
            <hr class="dot-line">
            <p>A while back - I think probably 4 years ago, a close family friend was having dinner at our home. Alberto can only be described as an "everyday guy". In his late 40's, back then was holding down a normal "9-5" job, and was probably the most out-of-sync person I've ever met in terms of using computers and the web.</p>

            <p>While eating, he was telling my big brother about this crazy thing he'd got into - something called <a href="http://fxmen.binboom.cpa.clicksure.com">Binary Options trading</a>. To be honest, it seemed like Chinese to me to at the time! Anyway, being a real information freak, I quickly got into the conversation, and what I found out was simply amazing.</p>
            
            <p>Alberto, using his smartphone (back then he had an iPhone) and laptop, was making around $300 a day in his free time by trading Binary Options. He showed us his bank statement (he likes to brag!) and, every week for the previous 3 months, he'd been getting deposits of $2,000-$3,000.</p>
            
            <p>I've got to admit, my initial reaction was excitement, but then I thought to myself "Hang on - this is Binary Options trading - what do I know about this... I know nothing!". As it turns out, a brief explanation by Alberto proved that the complexity implied by the name didn't match the simplicity of the topic!</p>
            
            <p>In plain terms, your job as a Binary Options trader is simply to speculate whether the price of a stock or currency pair will be above or below its current price after 60 seconds. If you believe price will be higher then you click a "CALL" button, and if you believe it will be lower, you click a "PUT" button instead. One click and you're done! And the best part is that you only need to be correct in terms of direction - how far price moves isn't a factor!</p>
            
            <p>Opening a brokerage account is easy too - it takes literally 2 minutes, and you only need to deposit $250 to get started. You can then download some <a href="http://fxmen.binboom.cpa.clicksure.com">special (FREE) software</a> which tells you whether to click the "CALL" or "PUT" button. And yes, the software is 100% automatic.</p>
            
            <p>Around 2 weeks after Alberto exposed us to this exciting opportunity, I'd started using this free softwrae myself and, guess what? I was making even more money than Alberto!</p>
            
            <p>Well, in fairness, that's because he started out with $250 and I started out with $400. But who cares? The objective is to make as much as you can, right?</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, I sat down yesterday and created the comparison chart below, which compares Binary Options trading with other online opportunities:</p>
            <p align="center"><img alt="" src="images/compare-img.png"></p>
            <h3>Conclusion: The Real Bottom Line</h3>
            <hr class="dot-line">
			<p>Trading Binary Options can be really profitable and, in my opinion, is currently the best income opportunity the web has to offer.</p>

<p>But I have to warn you: don't let the term "Binary Options" scare you! I was foolishly scared when I first heard it, but you can't even begin to imagine how easy it is to get into this opportunity.</p>

<p>Most people I've talked to have highlighted two main aspects they love about this style of opportunity: the freedom and the high income.</p>

<p>If you want to download the software I'm using, you can. It's 100% free and can be downloaded by <a href="http://fxmen.binboom.cpa.clicksure.com">clicking here</a>.</p>
