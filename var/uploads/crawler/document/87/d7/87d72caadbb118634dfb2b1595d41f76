<h3><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201502/4427/">Why Build a Water Park at a Theme Park Resort?</a></h3>
<p><i>Published: February 18, 2015 at 10:16 PM</i></p>



<div id="copy">Universal Orlando Resort has begun work on a new water park, codenamed "Project 533," to go on a 33-acre site south of the Cabana Bay Beach Resort. Last August, Universal trademarked the name "Wondersea Island" for a water park development, and the plans for the new park include "slides and pools plus various recreational facilities. A tall 'volcano' with slides will be constructed in the southern portion of the site," according to documents filed last Friday with the South Florida Water Management District.<P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/art/2015/wondersea-location.jpg" width=560 height=665 alt="New Universal Orlando water park location"></div><P>Universal owns the Wet 'n Wild water park located across Interstate 4 from the main resort property. But the new park would be located adjacent to the Cabana Bay and upcoming Sapphire Falls resort, in a much more convenient location for on-site Universal Orlando hotel visitors.<P>Why build a water park on what might be the last major remaining undeveloped parcel on the main Universal Orlando property? Universal's competitors — Walt Disney World and SeaWorld Orlando — operate on-site water parks that drew more visitors than Universal's Wet 'n Wild in 2013, the latest year for which data is available from the TEA/AECOM attendance report.<P>And yet... those water park aren't attracting anywhere <i>near</i> as many visitors as their theme park siblings. Here are the attendance numbers for the five most popular water parks in the United States, from the TEA/AECOM report:<ol><li>Typhoon Lagoon: 2.14 million</li><li>Blizzard Beach: 1.97 million</li><li>Aquatica: 1.55 million</li><li>Wet 'n Wild: 1.26 million</li><li>Schlitterbahn: 1.03 million</li></ol><P>Compare that with the lowest theme park attendance at the top four water parks' resorts:<ul><li>Disney's Hollywood Studios: 10.11 million</li><li>SeaWorld Orlando: 5.09 million</li><li>Universal Studios Florida: 7.06 million</li></ul><P>The top water parks in America each draw between 18-30% the annual attendance of their resort's weakest theme park. The most popular water park in America, Typhoon Lagoon, wouldn't place among the top 20 theme parks in the country for annual attendance, trailing number-20 Busch Gardens Williamsburg by more than 500,000 visitors a year, according to TEA/AECOM. (If you're looking for a reason why we do not devote much attention to covering water parks here on Theme Park Insider, well, there ya go.)<P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/photos/images/typhoon%20lagoon.jpg" width=540 height=365 alt="Typhoon Lagoon"><br><i>Walt Disney World's Typhoon Lagoon</i></div><P>So why do so many theme parks build water parks? Why not build more theme parks, instead?<P>In a word: cost. <P>Perhaps no park in America has developed better water park attractions than <a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/reviews/holiday_world/">Holiday World and Splashin' Safari</a> in Santa Claus, Indiana, which in recent years has debuted two of the longest water coasters in the world. At the same time, the park also has installed world-class roller coasters, including a new Bolliger & Mabillard launched wing coaster, Thunderbird, which will debut this spring. That puts President/CEO Matt Eckert in a perfect position to judge the relative cost of developing high-quality water park and theme park attractions.<P>"When you look at cost to build, cost of maintenance, and throughput, a major ride for Splashin' Safari will cost less than a major ride for Holiday World," Eckert said. <P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/photos/images/voyage2.jpg" width=450 height=298 alt="Holiday World and Splashin' Safari"><br><i>Holiday World and Splashin' Safari</i></div><P>So why not double down on water parks, and skip those expensive theme park attractions?<P>Because, let's face it — people are far more likely to book airplane flights and pile the kids into the car for a long roadtrip to ride a record-setting roller coaster or visit a beloved character such as Harry Potter than they are to visit even the best water park. But a water park next to a theme park can help entice a family to extend its visit an extra day more cost-effectively than building enough additional theme park attractions to do the same thing. (And, in the case of regional theme parks, water parks can help convince more locals to go ahead and buy that annual pass than the theme park alone would.)<P>Which brings us back to Universal Orlando. With new additions such as Transformers, Diagon Alley and the upcoming (though still-unannounced) King Kong ride, Universal Orlando offers a solid two-day experience for visitors, and enough to tempt many fans to consider staying a third day (or longer). How can Universal convince more of its visitors to extend their stays, for the most cost-effective way possible?<P>Wet n' Wild is drawing more than a million visitors a year, but insiders suggest that many of them are locals, who've been coming to the park since before it was owned by Universal. Located across the Interstate from the main property, Wet n' Wild isn't up to Universal's theming standards and isn't convenient enough to tempt on-site visitors the way that a new, more conveniently located, Universal Creative-designed, world-class water park would. A 33-acre plot, on-site but separated from the resort's two theme parks, is too small to develop as a third theme park gate. But it's a good size for a water park, which Universal Creative can develop for far less expense than it would need to build a half-day's worth (or more) of theme park attractions elsewhere on property.<P>So what of Wet n' Wild? We've heard that Universal has been letting go some of its water park managers in recent months, and Universal is spitballing plans for redeveloping the site. Wondersea Island (assuming that will be the name for the new park) allows Universal Orlando to retain a water park attraction while potentially swapping Wet n' Wild's local visitors for freer-spending out-of-town hotel guests who would extend their stays to enjoy the new, better water park.<P>Don't get too carried away as details about Universal Orlando's new water park emerge over the next year. In a best-case scenario, the new water park will draw more visitors than Wet n' Wild, but it won't come close to drawing even a third of the visits that one of Universal Orlando's theme parks will. It won't drive attendance to the resort the way that Transformers has, or Kong will. (Nothing, by the way, drives traffic like Harry Potter, so let's not even bring that into the conversation.) But a well-designed, conveniently located water park might help Universal Orlando Resort entice more of the people who come to visit its theme parks to stay — and spend — just a little bit longer. <P>And <i>that</i> is why theme parks build water parks.<P><b>You Might Also Like:</b><ul><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201411/4307/">King Kong Construction Update, Plus a First Look at the Blueprints</a></li><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201409/4204/">Universal Orlando reveals the name for its fifth hotel: Sapphire Falls Resort</a></li><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201410/4247/">Holiday World tops off its new steel coaster, Thunderbird</a></li><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201502/4418/">Central Florida Theme Park Construction Round-Up</a> (February 2015)</li></ul></div>

<h3><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201502/4426/">The Magic Kingdom Breaks the $100 Barrier This Weekend</a></h3>
<p><i>Published: February 18, 2015 at 8:16 PM</i></p>



<div id="copy">Sources are telling us that Walt Disney World's annual ticket price increase is coming this weekend, and that the Magic Kingdom will be the first theme park to break the $100-a-day price barrier.<P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/photos/images/PB215126.JPG" width=550 height=400 alt="Olaf, Anna, and Elsa"><br><i>One thing that's not 'Frozen' at the Disney theme parks is the ticket price.</i></div><P>We are expecting the price increase to happen on Sunday, Feb. 22 at the Walt Disney World Resort and possibly at the Disneyland Resort in California, as well. (Disney raised its ticket prices on Feb. 23 last year.) The one-day price of an adult ticket to the Magic Kingdom will rise from $99 to $105, while the one-day adult ticket price for the other three parks &#8212; Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom — will rise from $94 to $99. Prices for multi-day tickets and park-hoppers will increase down the line, as well.<P>A Disney ticket price increase typically triggers a response from the Universal Orlando Resort, so if you have scheduled or are thinking about a visit to the Disney or Universal theme parks within the next few months, you would do well to buy your tickets in advance before the weekend, to lock in the current prices. Disney tickets may be purchased in advance and will not expire until 14 days after their first use. Universal does offer some date-specific discounts on its tickets, so check the fine print if you buy one of the special deals offered on its website.<P>In addition to buying tickets in advance, you can save by purchasing multi-day ticket packages. Frankly, almost no one pays the full price for one-day tickets to Walt Disney World. (That's like paying the rack rate to stay at a hotel.) Most visitors instead buy multi-day tickets, to see more of the four theme parks at the resort. With multi-day tickets, the price per day to get into the Disney World theme parks falls to less than $40 a day on tickets of nine days or more. Similar discounts on multi-day tickets are available at the Universal Orlando Resort.<P><b>For More on Buying Theme Park Tickets:</b><ul><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201501/4392/">Where Do You Buy Discount Theme Park Tickets?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/tickets/">How to Save Money on a Theme Park Vacation</a> (Including links to online ticket stores)</li><li><a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/discussion/thread.cfm?page=434">Disney World Ticket Price Increase Coming Sunday</a></li></ul></div>
