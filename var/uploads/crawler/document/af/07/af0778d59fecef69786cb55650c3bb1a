      <div class="faqs_content">
        <h4>What is PayPal Credit?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>PayPal Credit is a line of credit from Comenity Capital Bank that gives you the flexibility to pay for your purchase now, or pay over time. It’s easy to apply and easy to use.</p>
          <br/>
          <p><a href=" https://www.securecheckout.billmelater.com/paycapture-content/fetch?hash=PD4106KD&content=bmlweb/bmlwebtnc.html" target="_blank">View PayPal Credit terms and conditions. </a></p>
        </div>
        <h4>How does PayPal Credit work?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>You can use PayPal Credit on purchases at thousands of stores that accept PayPal. It’s also available for purchases on eBay and exclusively at thousands of other online stores.</p>
          <p>Here's how:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Check out with PayPal and then choose PayPal Credit.</li>
            <li>Answer 2 quick questions and accept the terms.</li>
            <li>You’ll know within seconds if you are approved.</li>
            <li>Look for your PayPal Credit statement via email.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If your PayPal Credit account is linked to your PayPal account, your offers may vary.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>How do I start using PayPal Credit?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Select PayPal Credit as your payment choice during checkout. You’ll be asked to provide your date of birth and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number, and then to agree to the terms and conditions, to apply for a PayPal Credit account. You’ll know within seconds if you are approved. And here’s the cool thing: link your PayPal Credit account to your PayPal account and you’ll see it as a payment option when you checkout with PayPal.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>How do I select PayPal Credit as my payment source?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>There are two ways to choose PayPal Credit. Some merchants have a PayPal Credit option at checkout. If they do, you can simply choose that option. If you don’t see a PayPal Credit option, check out with PayPal, and then you’ll have the option to select PayPal Credit as your payment method. Either way a window will appear on your screen where you’ll provide your date of birth and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number, and then agree to the terms and conditions. Approval takes just seconds and you can complete your purchase.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Can I use PayPal Credit when shopping on eBay?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes. Look for the PayPal Credit option on the Choose Payment Method page, or when you checkout with PayPal. PayPal Credit can be used for most purchases on eBay, except in the following categories: adult, digital goods, weapons, alcohol, and vehicles (PayPal Credit is available for auto parts and accessories).</p>
        </div>
        <h4>How does the "No Payments + No Interest if paid in full in 6 Months" offer work?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>You’ll have the option to make no payments for 6 months, on qualifying purchases. You will receive monthly statements and can make payments at any time. As long as you pay in full by the promotion expiration date, you will not be billed interest for that purchase. If you do not pay in full, interest will be calculated from the posting date (which is usually within a few days after the purchase date) and will be billed to your account. </p>
        </div>
        <h4> How do I pay my PayPal Credit bill?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>You’ll receive monthly statements and can choose to pay in full or over time (interest charges may apply). For your convenience, once you link your PayPal Credit and PayPal accounts, you can keep track of your purchases and make payments on PayPal.com. Pay your balance due from either your PayPal balance or your bank account.</p><br/>
            
          <p style="line-height:2">You can also mail your payments in to:<br/>
          PayPal Credit <br>
          P.O. Box 105658<br>
          Atlanta, GA 30348-5658</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Is there an annual fee to use PayPal Credit?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Nope! There is no annual fee to use PayPal Credit.<a href=" https://www.securecheckout.billmelater.com/paycapture-content/fetch?hash=PD4106KD&content=bmlweb/bmlwebtnc.html" target="_blank"> See the Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
        </div>
        <h4>Do I have a Credit Line and how much will it be?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes. Once you’re approved, Comenity Capital Bank will open a PayPal Credit account with a Credit Line of at least $250.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>How do I increase my credit line with PayPal Credit?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>You can continue to use PayPal Credit for purchases and, if those purchases cause your outstanding balance to exceed your credit line, we’ll evaluate you for a credit line increase. Your eligibility for a credit increase is determined by your credit history and customer history with PayPal Credit, and the Terms and Conditions. This will happen automatically during checkout, so you don’t even need to ask. </p>
        </div>
        <h4>What is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p><strong>The Annual Percentage Rate for standard purchases and cash advances on a PayPal Credit line is 19.99%,</strong> although some special offers have a lower, promotional APR. <strong>The Minimum Interest Charge is $2.00.</strong> Of course, you can choose to pay your entire balance by the payment due date to avoid interest charges. <a href=" https://www.securecheckout.billmelater.com/paycapture-content/fetch?hash=PD4106KD&content=bmlweb/bmlwebtnc.html" target="_blank">Learn more about the interest rate.</a></p>
        </div>
        <h4>What does ‘Subject to Credit Approval’ mean?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>PayPal Credit is a credit account that you can use to make purchases and send money. Comenity Capital Bank will review and consider your credit report and other credit related information prior to opening your account and establishing your credit line. Creditworthiness is determined by Comenity Capital Bank. This process happens in a matter of seconds as part of the PayPal Credit checkout process. Once you are a PayPal Credit customer, you can use your credit line to make purchases. If you make a purchase that would cause your outstanding balance to go above your credit line, we will review your credit history and history with PayPal Credit to instantly determine whether to increase your credit line.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Do you check my credit report every time I make a purchase?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>No. A credit report is reviewed when you apply for PayPal Credit and occasionally when you attempt to increase your credit line. Periodically, we’ll obtain updates of your report, but these updates have no impact on your credit score. If for any reason your Credit Line is decreased, you’ll be notified of the reason in writing.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Is there a fee for late payments?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes, you will be charged a <a href=" https://www.securecheckout.billmelater.com/paycapture-content/fetch?hash=PD4106KD&content=bmlweb/bmlwebtnc.html" target="_blank">late fee </a>for each month that the minimum payment is not paid by the payment due date. The first time you’re late, the amount of the late fee will be the same amount as the missed payment, up to $25. If you’re late again, the late fee will be up to $35.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Does PayPal Credit protect me from liability for unauthorized charges?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes! PayPal Credit provides “zero fraud liability” protection, the same protection provided by most major credit cards. This means you are not responsible for unauthorized charges. And we verify your identity with top-of-mind information such as your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number, so there’s no account number that can be lost or stolen..</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Where else can I use PayPal Credit?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>PayPal Credit is available on purchases at thousands of stores that accept PayPal. It’s also available for purchases on eBay and exclusively at thousands of other online stores.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Why should I link my PayPal Credit and PayPal accounts?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p><a href="https://www.billmelater.com/linkpaypal/index.html" target="_blank">Linking your accounts</a> means you’ll be able to use PayPal Credit at most places PayPal is accepted. You can also get six months to pay for your purchases of $99 or more through PayPal Credit - and you could score deals such as free shipping, valuable discounts and promotional offers! By linking, you can also easily manage both accounts—pay your bill, view recent activity, set payment reminders, and much more at PayPal.com.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>I have a separate PayPal Credit (formerly Bill Me Later) account. How do I add it to my PayPal account?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>It’s easy! There are three ways to link your PayPal Credit and PayPal accounts:
		<ul>
          <li>Log in to your PayPal account, click Profile, select “PayPal Credit,” then click Update Preferences.</li>
          <li>Click <a href="https://www.billmelater.com/linkpaypal/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> or enter <a href="https://www.billmelater.com/linkpaypal/index.html" target="_blank">billmelater.com/linkpaypal</a> into your browser for step-by-step instructions.</li>
          <li>The next time you’re checking out with PayPal, just select PayPal Credit as your way to pay.</li>
		</ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>I’ve linked my PayPal Credit and PayPal accounts. Do I still need to register?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Nope. Once you link your accounts there is no registration step. You can simply log into PayPal.com and get access to up-to-the-minute account activity, special discounts, free shipping, and promotional financing offers from your favorite merchants.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>What if I do not currently have a PayPal account?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>In order to link your PayPal Credit and PayPal accounts, you must first open a PayPal account. If you do not already have a PayPal Credit account, you can sign up for both accounts at the same time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>What if my PayPal account is blocked or closed?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>If your PayPal account is blocked or closed, you will not be able to go through the online linking process.  Please call PayPal Credit Customer Service at 1-888-221-1161 and we will do our best to help.</p>
        </div>
        
                <h4>What happens if I already have a PayPal cards (Smart Connect, PayPal MasterCard or eBay MasterCard) product linked to my PayPal account?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>If you already have a PayPal cards product linked to your account, you will not be able to add PayPal Credit to the same account. You will need to open a new PayPal account and link that to your PayPal Credit account.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Can I use PayPal Credit to send money?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes! You can now send money with PayPal Credit. It’s easy—simply log in to PayPal.com and select the Send Money tab. Enter the recipient’s email address or phone number, amount, and transaction type. Click Change to select PayPal Credit as your payment method, then confirm your payment details. Your transaction will appear on your monthly PayPal Credit statement. When you use PayPal Credit to send money, a flat fee of 2.9% + $.30 US dollars (USD) per transaction is included in your payment total. This is the same fee you pay when you use a debit or credit card to send money through PayPal. This feature is not available on mobile devices.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Will my funding sources transfer when I start managing my account on PayPal.com?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>No. Since the requirements for PayPal Credit and PayPal differ, we cannot add your current funding sources without you going through approval and set up process of adding them yourself. This is also a security feature to make sure you are in control of who has access to your accounts.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Will my previously scheduled payments transfer when I start managing my account on PayPal.com?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes. Any payments you have already scheduled will still process on time from your previous funding sources. You’ll even see them process through your new PayPal.com interface, even though you will not be able to access those funding sources until you add them directly into your PayPal account.</p>
        </div>
        
         <h4>Will all of my information be carried over to PayPal.com?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>When you link PayPal Credit to your PayPal account, all credit history will automatically transfer over. The linking process is what will enable statements, transactions, account history and profile information to be displayed on PayPal.com.  However, for security reasons, funding sources associated with your PayPal Credit account will not automatically transfer over PayPal.com.  You will need to manually establish or update any links from financial institutions (such as your bank accounts) to PayPal Credit. We recognize this poses a minor inconvenience for customers, but for security reasons this information will not automatically transfer.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Is there a number I can call if I have additional questions?</h4>
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>Yes there is. Our customer service department is available to assist you with your PayPal credit related issues. Please call us at 1-866-528-3733 and we will do our best to help.</p>
