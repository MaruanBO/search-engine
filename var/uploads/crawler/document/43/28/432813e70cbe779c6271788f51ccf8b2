FUSAI will disburse this loan in order to reach a population that doesn&#39;t currently work with Apoyo Integral. This type of loan covers basic services (like housing and water), and supports small business and agricultural activities. Borrowers come from low-income families in rural and peri-urban communities, and are considered to be too poor or lack the proper guarantees to get credit through traditional banks or microfinance institutions. Before receiving their loans, they are vetted by local community organizations and enrolled in classes in financial literacy, and the importance of sanitation, potable water and clean energy. Additionally, FUSAI enables borrowers to guarantee one another and take out loans smaller than El Salvador&#39;s average. Important to note is El Salvador is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world, holding the 2nd place in the ranking of murders per capita. All these FUSAI borrowers live in areas considered by the police as highly violent and dangerous, mainly because of gangs influence. Main risks they face in these areas are thefts, extortions, kidnappings and murders. <\/span>"},"use":"to invest in medications and vitamins to sell on foot.","loanUseOriginalLanguage":null,"hasCurrencyExchangeLossLenders":false,"delinquent":false,"location":{"town":null,"country":{"id":75,"isoCode":"SV","name":"El Salvador","region":"Central America","lat":13.8333333,"long":-88.9166667},"lat":13.8333333,"long":-88.9166667},"partnerId":81,"partnerName":"Apoyo Integral","sharePrice":{"amount":"25.00","currency":"USD"},"borrowerCount":1,"lenderRepaymentTerm":14,"matcherAccountId":null,"fundraisingDate":1423179002,"disbursalDate":1418889600,"endedDate":null,"refundedDate":null,"defaultedDate":null,"expiredDate":null,"inactiveExpiredDate":null,"plannedExpirationDate":1425771002,"plannedInactiveExpirationDate":1424732416,"dafEligible":true,"dafFundedAmount":{"amount":"0.00","currency":"USD"},"linkedIsProblem":false},{"id":835748,"name":"Myriam Azucena","description":{"es":"La Sra.

Her children are school-age and preschool age. Nasiykat has a secondary education and has been raising livestock and planting crops for five years as the main source of income for her family. Thanks to her perseverance, dedication, and hard work, she currently owns 0.50 hectares of land where she plants clover and potatoes. She also has a cow, two bulls, 15 chickens, and 8 turkeys.

Before receiving their loans, they are vetted by local community organizations and enrolled in classes in financial literacy, and the importance of sanitation, potable water and clean energy. Additionally, FUSAI enables borrowers to guarantee one another and take out loans smaller than El Salvador&#39;s average. Important to note is El Salvador is considered one of the most dangerous countries in the world, holding the 2nd place in the ranking of murders per capita. All these FUSAI borrowers live in areas considered by the police as highly violent and dangerous, mainly because of gangs influence.

James is a hardworking, ambitious, and go-getter farmer who is 57 years of age. He hails from Kiamugunda, a small village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. He comes from a very humble background; he did not manage to attend college, but that did not kill his spirit to succeed.\r\n\r\nHe has actively been involved in farming for the past 10 years. Although he has made great strides in farming, he wants to diversify his farming and is kindly seeking a loan to buy pigs. Pig farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya and James, having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of that to improve his living conditions. James loves pig farming because pigs are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry, which require special care and attention. James believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling pork meat to a ready and available market. As far as the market of pig products is concerned, demand is greater than supply. James always says, \u201cTo become a successful pig farmer you need three ingredients and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\" \r\n\r\nWith the loan he believes he will become a successful pig farmer and will be able to realize his dream of transforming his life. Having farmed for the past 10 years, James finds it very enjoyable to raise pigs because he does not spend more money on buying food. Pigs feed on remains that can be collected from hotels and restaurants and hence save a lot of money. James will also sell manure from the pigs and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions. Profits from selling pig meat to the local market and to the industry that produces sausages and bacon will be used to fully repay the loan. Your support of this go-getting farmer could give him an enormous push.
