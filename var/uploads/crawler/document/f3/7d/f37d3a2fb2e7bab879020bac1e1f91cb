Similarly, if we feel overwhelmed with a task, having a place to turn to for encouragement can be the motivator we need to keep going even when we feel entirely like giving up.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say you have to be an extrovert or full time, networking-pro to build the type of close group or community that encourages grit.

Instead of looking for a brand new idea, recall your most recent aggravation. For Branson, it was trying to invest money: \u00a0<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We went into a financial services company\u2014we set up a bank\u2014because I wanted to invest money. And when the guy agreed to invest money for me, I looked down at the piece of paper, and it said &#8220;bid-offer spread 5%.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, sorry, what is bid-offer spread? I\u2019m dyslexic. I don\u2019t understand these things.&#8221; He sort of looked a bit shifty, and when he had left, I asked someone else what bid-offer spread meant, and was told it meant he took 5% of my money before he even started. And so I thought, &#8220;Screw that, we\u2019re going into this business and we\u2019re going to compete!&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From music festivals to airlines to health clubs to financial services, if Branson doesn&#8217;t like it, he designs it better himself. Although he may not seem like one to get annoyed by hotel hidden charges, like a $12 bottle of water in the room, it\u2019s quite the opposite. That, along with other frustrations, has Virgin Group now opening their own chain of hotels starting in Chicago.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of criticizing someone else\u2019s work, look at it as an opportunity to do it yourself, and to do it better. Ideas don\u2019t have to be new, they just have to be better.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcodesign.com\/3041877\/11-questions-for-richard-branson-in-a-place-called-the-shag-room\" target=\"_blank\">via<\/a>]<\/p>\n","categories":false,"classes":"post-39043 workbook type-workbook status-publish hentry","comments_count":"2","clear":null,"date":"Feb 18, 2015 - 7:00am","desktop_image":false,"excerpt":"Ideas don\u2019t have to be new, they just have to be better.","id":39043,"image":false,"loading":null,"phone_image":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/99u.com\/workbook\/39043\/richard-branson-dont-like-it-make-it-yourself-do-it-better","post_type":"workbook","read_more":false,"shorturl":"http:\/\/99u.com\/39043","show_comments":false,"time_ago":"1 day ago","timestamp":"2015-02-18T07:00:44+00:00","title":"Richard Branson: Don\u0027t like Something?

Either she&#8217;s barely heard or she&#8217;s judged as too aggressive. When a man says virtually the same thing, heads nod in appreciate for his fine idea. As a result, women often decide that saying less is more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>They reinforce that the long term solution to this problem is to increase the number of women in leadership roles, so that people become more accustomed to women&#8217;s contributing and leading. But your organization can also start today with an easy solution:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/hacking-techs-diversity-problem\" target=\"_blank\">Interrupt<\/a>\u00a0this gender bias. Just as orchestras that use blind auditions\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w5903\" target=\"_blank\">increase the number of women who are selected,<\/a>\u00a0organizations can increase women\u2019s contributions by adopting practices that focus less on the speaker and more on the idea. For example, in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.innovationtournaments.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">innovation tournament<\/a>s, employees submit suggestions and solutions to problems anonymously.

Researchers sent a group of participants two messages, one a flirtatious social email and one extending a job interview request, and added emoticons to some of each. The results: the smileys in <em>both<\/em> types of emails made the recipient like the sender more, and also feel that the sender liked them more. Even in the work email, the sender\u2019s credibility wasn\u2019t affected at all:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a task-oriented context, where impersonal, cold, and unsociable features of computer-mediated communication are strongly encouraged in order to build credibility or professionalism, using emoticons in e-mail might create a positive expectancy violation by being friendly, emotional, and personal.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Positive emoticons can also <a href=\"http:\/\/aisel.aisnet.org\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1681&amp;context=jais&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5%26q%3Demoticon%26scisbd%3D1#search=%22emoticon%22\" target=\"_blank\">soften the blow of negative feedback<\/a>, and assure the recipient of the critique of the deliverer&#8217;s good intentions. Perhaps most convincingly, they&#8217;ve also been shown to contribute to a generally happier workplace:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since we don\u2019t get the chance to share facial expressions and other nonverbal cues in our emails, they can sometimes be tougher to interpret.

In an interview with<em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessoffashion.com\/2015\/01\/creative-class-solve-sundsbo-photographer.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Business of Fashion<\/a><\/em>, he talks about the time he worked an assistant to the visionary photographer Nick Knight:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The thing is, if you work with someone like Nick, or like Bruce Weber, you get coloured by it \u2014 we\u2019re sitting here talking about him [Knight] now. It takes a bit of time and effort to move away from it. The memory of when I first found my voice was not one thing. You do something and say, \u2018Is that it?\u2019 and then another and ask, \u2018Is that it?\u2019 and a third and a fourth. You look back at three or four things and then you can see something looking at them together.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We tend to be influenced by those we look up to. While emulating is a good way to practice, you&#8217;ll never stand on your own until you find a voice of your own. Sundsb\u00f8 suggests reviewing your work to discover elements that are distinctly your own, some common\u00a0traits that tie all of your work together:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first stories were the wire frame story for Dazed &amp;\u00a0Confused, the airbrush story for The Face \u2014 that\u2019s when I felt that I was finding my own voice. I went to Hy\u00e8res [International Festival of Fashion and Photography, where he was voted best newcomer] in 1999 after about a year of fashion photography and, when I hung my stuff on the wall, people said, \u2018Oh, did you do that, and that, and that?\u2019 There were six different things. People thought, \u2018Oh, you did all of them but they all look so different.\u2019 I remember thinking, \u2018I\u2019m all of those things, not just one.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite the diversity of his work, there are threads that run through Sundsb\u00f8\u2019s oeuvre: an extraordinary use of lighting, an engagement with technology, a high level of precision, and a taste for fantasy.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessoffashion.com\/2015\/01\/creative-class-solve-sundsbo-photographer.html\" target=\"_blank\">via<\/a>]<\/p>\n","categories":false,"classes":"post-38635 workbook type-workbook status-publish hentry","comments_count":"4","clear":null,"date":"Feb 11, 2015 - 7:00am","desktop_image":false,"excerpt":"Stop emulating and be yourself.","id":38635,"image":false,"loading":null,"phone_image":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/99u.com\/workbook\/38635\/how-to-find-your-voice","post_type":"workbook","read_more":false,"shorturl":"http:\/\/99u.com\/38635","show_comments":false,"time_ago":"1 week ago","timestamp":"2015-02-11T07:00:55+00:00","title":"How to Find Your Voice","video":false},"38953":{"author":"<a href=\"\/author\/tanner-christensen\">Tanner Christensen<\/a>","body":"<div id=\"attachment_38969\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-normal wp-image-38969\" alt=\"Photo by Rick Harrison via Flickr\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.99u.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-04-at-10.43.41-PM-550x249.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"249\" \/>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Rick Harrison via Flickr<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>While we may say, and mean, that we want to make an impact with our work, or get a raise, or to be viewed as a leader in our industry, we often stall or miss big opportunities in our careers due to the \u201cimpact trap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The trap works like this: You work diligently in order to achieve a certain level of what you view as success, only to discover the bigger or better opportunities you could be working toward. Because you&#8217;ve already put so much work into getting where you are, you become afraid of moving toward any other potential opportunities to grow in fear of losing what you&#8217;ve worked so hard to gain. As a result, we become content with our level of success, even if moving away from it means we might become happier, healthier, richer, or in a place where we can have an even greater impact.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid the impact trap, we must focus our efforts on longer-term, and more broad, targets for success.\u00a0Facebook VP of Advertising, Andrew Bosworth (or Boz), explains:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we aren\u2019t willing to take risks then we are relying entirely on having picked the right hill to begin with. That is a tall order given that we pick our starting position when we have the least information about the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>We must take the long view of our careers. Optimizing for immediate impact is a reasonable thing to do day by day but to avoid the impact trap we must consider impact over the course of years or even decades. That way when we get to the top of yet another mountain we have the courage to once again forge into the valley to pursue even higher peaks.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As Boz tells us, the problem with any temporary pursuit of success is that we often make the decision to pursue it while we\u2019re at the bottom of the hill. Moving closer to the top allows us to see other, bigger opportunities. If we\u2019re too diligently focused on the hill we\u2019re working on now, we\u2019re likely to miss the chance to move toward the bigger hills later on.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than focusing entirely on a big promotion for validation that we\u2019ve finally \u201cmade it,\u201d we should imagine where we want to be five, ten, or even twenty, years from now, and let that be the vision guiding our decisions.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/boz.com\/articles\/the-impact-trap.html\" target=\"_blank\">via<\/a>]<\/p>\n","categories":false,"classes":"post-38953 workbook type-workbook status-publish hentry","comments_count":"1","clear":null,"date":"Feb 10, 2015 - 7:00am","desktop_image":false,"excerpt":"Plan long-term rather than focusing on the closest \"win.\"","id":38953,"image":false,"loading":null,"phone_image":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/99u.com\/workbook\/38953\/the-impact-trap-might-be-why-you-never-got-that-promotion","post_type":"workbook","read_more":false,"shorturl":"http:\/\/99u.com\/38953","show_comments":false,"time_ago":"1 week ago","timestamp":"2015-02-10T07:00:46+00:00","title":"The Impact Trap: How We End up Settling","video":false},"39153":{"author":"<a href=\"\/author\/sasha-vanhoven\">Sasha VanHoven<\/a>","body":false,"categories":"<a href=\"http:\/\/99u.com\/category\/office-dynamics\">Office Dynamics<\/a>","classes":"post-39153 articles type-articles status-publish hentry category-career-development category-leadership category-office-dynamics","comments_count":"19","clear":"true","date":"2015-02-09 11:33:23","desktop_image":"http:\/\/cdn.99u.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/TheNewMentor572x429-460x220.png?cb=1","excerpt":"There is more than one great mentor out there waiting for you.

It feels impossible to find the time to get those seven to eight hours of sleep every night when you&#8217;re trying to cram in a full day of top-tier work, plus some semblance of a social life, relaxation time, and a chance to reflect or meditate on it all.

[The] effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eight\u2014when your breath is so shallow and short\u2014your body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath, and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds, causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>When you&#8217;re stressed out or anxious, like when you&#8217;re unable to fall asleep, you&#8217;re probably under-breathing. By extending your inhale you force your lungs to take in more oxygen, then by holding the breath you allow that air to flow through your bloodstream. The 4-7-8 breathing exercise slows your heart rate, bringing in more oxygen to your body, which in turn calms your heart and your central nervous system, and thereby your mind.<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/www.byrdie.com\/how-to-fall-asleep-fast\" target=\"_blank\">via<\/a>]<\/p>\n","categories":false,"classes":"post-38751 workbook type-workbook status-publish hentry","comments_count":"5","clear":null,"date":"Feb 9, 2015 - 7:00am","desktop_image":false,"excerpt":"Try the \u201c4-7-8\u201d breathing trick.","id":38751,"image":false,"loading":null,"phone_image":false,"permalink":"http:\/\/99u.com\/workbook\/38751\/how-to-fall-asleep-in-under-1-minute","post_type":"workbook","read_more":false,"shorturl":"http:\/\/99u.com\/38751","show_comments":false,"time_ago":"1 week ago","timestamp":"2015-02-09T07:00:15+00:00","title":"How to Fall Asleep In Less Than 1 Minute","video":false},"39027":{"author":"<a href=\"\/author\/sarah-kathleen-peck\">Sarah Kathleen Peck<\/a>","body":false,"categories":"<a href=\"http:\/\/99u.com\/category\/hiring\">Hiring<\/a>","classes":"post-39027 articles type-articles status-publish hentry category-career-development category-hiring","comments_count":"35","clear":"true","date":"2015-02-06 11:18:24","desktop_image":"http:\/\/cdn.99u.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/InterviewQuestions460x220.png?cb=1","excerpt":"Ever start a new job and realize it wasn\u0027t everything you were promised?

Psychological research shows that we tend to avoid anything that we perceive to be complex.<\/p>\n<p>Complex tasks require our energy and knowledge, while also competing with any stressors placed on us by our environment. Any time we encounter something that brings us face-to-face with the potential to lose time, feel dumb, or take a hit to our ego, we feel stuck or lost as a result. This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sims.monash.edu.au\/staff\/darnott\/biastax.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">complexity bias<\/a>\u00a0in our thinking makes us less inclined to do what are ultimately simple things that we merely perceive to be difficult. Which makes us miss opportunities, fall behind on good habits, and ignore our goals.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, the solution is simple and easy to do in the face of complexity: write a list.\u00a0Lists give us clear steps for resolving the complexity of any challenge, saving us a lot of time and energy. They also help us spot holes in our knowledge by creating clear connections between one step and the next. If one list item doesn\u2019t easily follow the other, we can put in the work to fill the gap between the two.\u00a0A list simplifies even the most complex tasks into visual, manageable chunks of items that aren\u2019t anywhere as intimidating as the larger thing they make up. Even if a list item does feel overwhelming, it too can be broken down into an even smaller, and more manageable list.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>Author <a href=\"http:\/\/scottberkun.com\/2013\/make-a-list\/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Berkun explains<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>We convinced ourselves we\u2019re so amazing that if we\u2019re stuck it must require a high powered and complex method to save us, but that\u2019s hubris.
