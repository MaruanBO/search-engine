            </h1>
        Many people are turning to sign language as a teaching tool for their babies. Teaching sign language is not just a trendy thing to do, but it has become some of the earliest education many children are receiving as parents are taking the lead in educating children from their earliest days.&nbsp;
Teaching sign language to your baby may seem like a difficult task (especially if you don't know sign language yourself!), but it is easier than you may think. In fact, we teach babies sign language without even thinking about it! When we show them to wave, we're teaching them "bye-bye." When we point at objects, we're teaching them to try to tell us what they want by pointing as well.
A baby's mind is like a little sponge - it takes in everything. Learning comes so very easy to them. You will be amazed at just how quickly you and your baby can communicate using signs. It's never too late to start this process, and the whole task can be fun for the entire family!

        You want to go out - just Mommy and Daddy. That's perfectly normal, but you can't find a family member that is available to care for your children. So you decide to hire a babysitter.&nbsp;
Hiring a babysitter can be one of the most important choices you have to make for your children. There are a couple of steps that should be followed before hiring a babysitter. You first and most importantly never hire a sitter just because they seem nice. Some of the nicest people turn out to be serial killers! Don't get a potential babysitter the benefit of the doubt. Child predators come in every age, size, and gender.
You should always ask for references and be sure to check them out! Call to see if the references are credible and accurate. Sometimes, references are just friends and family members. You, as a parent, want previous babysitting jobs as references.
Just like an employer in an office building, your next step is an interview. Speak to the potential sitter. Have a nice conversation ... <a href="/post/Choosing-a-Safe-Babysitter">[More]</a>

        At some point in our driving years I suspect most all of us have to take defensive driving, whether to get rid of a ticket or maybe to just lower our insurance. For many years you only had one option, traffic school. But times and the options have changed.&nbsp;
Traffic school used to consist of getting up early on a Saturday morning or spending two nights during the week sitting in a classroom, listening to a instructor speak in a monotone voice and watching old 16mm films with 1950's cars and actors explaining the right and wrong way to drive a car. Although that option is probably available if you look for it, these days defensive driving class has gone high tech.&nbsp;
So what are the choices?&nbsp;
&bull; Traffic school with a twist: Some of the options you can choose from if you're looking for an in-class experience is humorous traffic school, traffic school with a meal, juggling and magic defensive driving classes.&nbsp;

        You want to be able to continue having a great relationship with your kids after separation or divorce. This means focusing on the kids rather than your ex-partner. You need to be parents rather than partners.
Breaking up is difficult enough without losing touch with your kids...you are feeling the loss of that everyday contact and you believe your children miss you too. You may not always be sure of the best way to be involved with your children. Remember - you are important to your children so make contact and hang in there for them.
Even if you live a long way from your children, you are still their parent. No matter who your children live with, they need and deserve to know that they are loved and wanted by both of their parents.
Children can be frightened by the strong emotions that often come from parental breakups.&nbsp;
You may have to work to regain their trust. Your children need to feel safe with you and this can take time.

        Moms are so busy these days, just by being a mom! They forget to take needed time out just for themselves. Rest and relaxation are two things that moms desperately need for sure, but often forget to put into their daily schedules. This is a must, as it not only rejuvenates a mom, but it helps to calm frazzled nerves.
There's a saying - if Mom's not happy, no one's happy. We know this is true - if a mom is angry, upset, or tired, the whole house is in a frenzy. Moms are, for the most part, in charge of making the house run smoothly. They change diapers, cook meals, help with homework, or just spend "mommy and me" time with their children. They're so much about everyone else. They must make sure to be all about themselves for at least thirty minutes each day.
There are a few techniques that any frazzled mom can use to get herself back on track: Go into a quiet room and read a book or a magazine. Don't forget a "do not disturb" sign. This can be hard to do, but if you have older childre... <a href="/post/Recreation-for-Moms">[More]</a>

        Invented by an innovative dating service entrepreneur, Jewish speed dating has become a phenomenon in the singles world. It takes careful coordination, a large member base in the immediate and surrounding area and a lot of work on the part of the dating service to pull it off and make it successful.&nbsp;
Essentially what happens is this: the dating service contacts a large number of its members in one major metropolitan area and invites them to a social event. For a modest fee they are guaranteed that there will be many members there of the opposite sex that they will be able to interact with during the event. The work involved has to do with getting a fairly equal amount of single men and women together at the same time and place and with a high probability of being compatible. Then, after a short pre-event socialization time, the Jewish speed dating begins. At the sound of a whistle, a gong or some sort of noisemaker, all of the women will sit down at prearranged chairs and tables ... <a href="/post/The-Benefits-of-Jewish-Speed-Dating">[More]</a>

            </h1>
        What is a good credit score? When you request a free copy of your credit report, you will find a score assigned to your credit history. This score will determine whether or not creditors will grant you the loan or credit that you want because it gives them an idea of your risk to repay. Generally, the answer to the question "what is a good credit score?" is the higher the better.
Once you have your credit report in your hands your first question should be "What is a good credit score and what is my credit score?" Each credit bureau has its own method of computing the credit scores and by themselves they don't really mean much. When the score is combined with your credit history, creditors can see at a glance how much money you owe and whether or not you have a good score. The scores range from 350 to 650, so if you are in the lower end of the score, then you will probably start to wonder "how can I raise my credit score?"

            </h1>
        What price to entertain our children? How much entertainment do our children need? At the risk of sounding like an old fuddy duddy, how were children entertained a 100 years ago when there were no television or computer games? Very simply I would imagine.
Imagination - The key to all adventures. Babies and small children will play with simple things like empty boxes, clothes pegs, pots and pans. To them they are all sorts of things because they use their imagination. They don't expect to be entertained with expensive toys or computer systems they just need to touch and feel things to have fun. Simple songs with actions will be remembered well beyond childhood years and hopefully be passed on to the next generation of children needing to be entertained. Dressing up, making things out of cardboard and paper, the possibilities are endless all that is needed is a little imagination.&nbsp;

Most parents don't start doing much until in the few years before college - which is often too late. So how can you pay for those huge college expenses? One partial solution is to get your kids to help out as much as they can.
There are lots of ways to do this. First and foremost is getting a job - a lot of parents don't want to do this, especially because of the risks that grades will suffer. If your child is likely to be competitive for a scholarship, this is a very important consideration, and you probably should go that route instead. If not, it actually isn't that harmful to work part time - five to ten hours a week doesn't interfere with studying much at all. If the alternative is not being able to pay for college, then it's well worth the risk - working teaches your kids responsibility and the value of a dollar, and if they can't balance school and a part-time job, ... <a href="/post/Saving-for-college-Put-your-kids-to-work">[More]</a>
