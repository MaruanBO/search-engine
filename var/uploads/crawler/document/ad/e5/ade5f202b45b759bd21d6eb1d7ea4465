<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The website you are visiting is owned and operated by Green Valley Natural Solutions.   We understand your concerns regarding collection of your personal data.   We appreciate your trust and respect your privacy.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell   or disclose information that identifies you personally or makes it   possible for other parties to contact them directly without your   consent.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an   advanced security protocol that protects your credit card information   and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are   encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information,   including your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be   read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls,   and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal   information.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Information:</strong> We only collect   personally identifiable information about you via this website when you   provide it in connection with a request for a product, service, or   information. For example, if you decide to place an order, we will ask   you for your shipping and billing address, phone number, email address,   credit card number and its expiration date. When you enter your   personally identifiable information on this website, you are giving your   consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal   information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer   that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you,   please do not provide us with any such information.</p>
<p>We may also collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally   identifiable information concerning your use of this website, such as   information regarding which of our pages are most popular.</p>
<p><strong>This website is intended for adults.</strong> We do not   knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of   13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that   the child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the   parent or guardian of that child should contact us at   CustServ@CancerDefeated.com if they want this information deleted from   our files so that it is not in retrievable form. If we otherwise obtain   knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child   under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that   information from our existing files so that it is not retrievable.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong> We also use cookies to assign   identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within   your cookie automatically identifies your computer to our servers every   time you visit our website. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find   out the identity of any user, but may be correlated with identity   information in our log files. You can turn off the cookie feature by   using your browser preference options.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties:</strong> We may rely on other companies and   individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include data   analysis firms, customer support specialists, web hosting companies, and   fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or   coordinate mailings). We may share personally identifiable information   with such third parties as appropriate for them to perform their   functions. We may also share personally identifiable information with   marketing partners or other direct marketers, so they can send you   notices about products or services that may be of interest to you. If   you do not want to receive marketing communications from them, see the   Opt-Out section below.</p>
<p>Our website may offer links to and from other third party sites.   These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices   independent from ours, and thus we cannot be responsible for their   policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if   you have questions about their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Email Marketing:</strong> We want to communicate with you via   email correspondence only if you want to hear from us. We may from time   to time send you email messages describing new products, special   offers, and great values. If for any reason you would no longer like to   receive email messages please see the Opt-Out section below.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt-out of receiving communication   from us and from other third parties by emailing us at:   customerservice@hyperionnaturalsolutions.com or writing to us at:</p>
<p><strong>Green Valley Natural Solutions</strong><br>
  <strong> PO Box 93</strong><br>
  <strong> Lexington, VA 24450</strong></p>
<p>In addition, when we contact you via email, we will include instructions to unsubscribe from future emails if you so choose.</p>
<p>Please note, if you decide opt-out, you may still receive   transactional email messages regarding your order (i.e. order   confirmation, shipping information, customer service notifications,   etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirement:</strong> We may disclose personal   information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that   such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to   claims or comply with legal process served on our company or the   website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the website, our   employees, guests or the public.</p>
<p><strong>Merger/Sale:</strong> In the event Green Valley Natural Solutions<br>
  and/or any of our assets are acquired by an unrelated third party, as   the owner of this customer information, we may disclose or sell the   information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale of   our company or the sale of a portion of our assets to a third party.   While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this   privacy policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in   effect.</p>
<p>Notification of Changes: We may revise this Privacy Policy from time   to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the   revised policy here. As we may make changes at any time without   notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy   Policy.</p>
