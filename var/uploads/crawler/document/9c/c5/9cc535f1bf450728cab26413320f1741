                        <p>Jacksonville, FL (February 12, 2015) – The Wounded Warrior Project<sup>®</sup> (WWP) produced documentary mini-series “Wounded: The Battle Back Home” will become available on Internet television network Netflix starting Sunday, February 15, 2015. The project, produced in conjunction with Austin-based Flow Nonfiction, was created to commemorate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of WWP and focuses on issues of critical importance to this generation of injured service members and their families through personal stories of struggle and resiliency.</p>
<p>“Wounded: The Battle Back Home” is a documentary series that brings to life the experiences of this generation of wounded veterans as they battle both the visible and invisible wounds of war. Each episode of the series allows viewers to follow these inspiring individuals as they navigate their post-war lives in a society that struggles to understand them and a system that is failing to support them. In addition to physical injuries, the series highlights the invisible wounds that our nation’s service members battle as they transition from the military to civilian life, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and military sexual trauma (MST).</p>

                        <p>Washington, D.C. (February 12, 2015)  – Wounded Warrior Project<sup>®</sup> (WWP) joined President Obama, veterans, and mental health advocates today at the White House for the signing of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act (SAV Act), which will help provide better support to injured veterans suffering from the invisible wounds of war, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>WWP is encouraged to see overwhelmingly bipartisan progress in efforts to improve mental health care and services and suicide prevention programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD). WWP worked closely with members of Congress to include provisions that authorize the VA to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists, and to establish a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning service members with accessing VA mental health care services.  WWP has seen the success that warrior mentors and community outreach can have through our Peer Support Program and Peer-Facilitated Support Groups; with 1,320 peer mentors, 1,277 warriors with mentors, and 222 warriors in 15 Peer-Facilitated Support Groups, we know that in many cases, it takes a veteran to help a veteran.</p>

                        <p>Washington, D.C. (February 11, 2015) – Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) today introduced the Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act of 2015, a bill that would expand the treatment and care at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); provide fertility treatment for spouses of severely wounded veterans; provide adoption assistance for veteran families; and make permanent a veterans child care services pilot program at VA. Wounded Warrior Project<sup>®</sup> (WWP) is proud to support this bill.</p>
<p>“We thank Senator Murray for her leadership in recognizing the devastating toll that service-incurred injuries can have on a warrior or spouse’s ability to start a family,” said Charlie Abell, executive vice president of Policy and Government Affairs at WWP. “In our decade-long experience working daily with this generation of wounded warriors, we know there is a need to provide reproductive services and adoption assistance to assist in helping severely wounded, ill, or injured veterans with fertility conditions to have families.”</p>

Soldier Ride brings injured service members from across the country together for a long weekend focused on physical health and wellness, camaraderie, and healing. </p>
<p>The event begins on March 5 with a bike fitting where injured service members are fit with adaptive equipment. That evening the public can join service members and Wounded Warrior Project staff at Space Center Theatre for a viewing of the film “Welcome to Soldier Ride” that documents how this inspirational ride began. Soldier Ride began as a one-man affair, when Chris Carney, working as a bartender at The Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett, NY, decided he wanted to do something to help returning veterans. He biked across the country in 2004, raising funds for Wounded Warrior Project.</p>
