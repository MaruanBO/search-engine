          <br />
  UPDATED DATE: January&nbsp;  7, 2014<br /><br />
  The following statement describes the overall company  Privacy Policy of AdBack. This Privacy Policy addresses how information is  collected and used by AdBack and our partners. This policy does not apply to  the practices of companies that AdBack does not own or control, or to people  that AdBack does not employ. If you have questions regarding this statement,  please contact <a href="mailto:customerservice@ad-back.net" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; ">customerservice@ad-back.net</a>.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>AdBack&rsquo;s Data  Collection:</strong><br /><br />
  <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND  USE: </strong><br /><br />
  Personally Identifiable Information (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;) is data about  you that is personally identifiable. Examples of personally identifiable  information include name, address, email address, credit card number or any  other information that is not otherwise publicly available. We use PII that has  been provided to us for business purposes such as to contact you, for billing,  or to otherwise render our services. We retain that information until removal  is requested. Anyone who has provided personally identifiable data to AdBack  may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or to be used only for the  service requested, by following the instructions listed under Personally  Identifiable Opt-Out later in this policy. We do not collect PII as a function  of our retargeting service.<br /><br />
  Non-Personally Identifiable Information (&ldquo;NPII&rdquo;) data is  collected by AdBack and our partners and is used for retargeting. We, and/or  one or more of our ad technology partners, may collect NPII from people who  visit our website or people who visit our clients&rsquo; websites. This data is  anonymous, and can include information such as web pages you&rsquo;ve viewed, date  and time of pageviews, domain type, location information associated with your  IP address, and your interactions to an ad delivered by us or our ad technology  partners. AdBack and our ad technology partners use different methods to  collect this type of data, including cookies and web beacons, and it is stored  indefinitely.<br /><br />
  <strong>ADBACK's USE OF COOKIES  AND WEB BEACONS:</strong><br /><br />
  Cookies are small text files that can store information.  There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session  cookies expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies stay on your  computer until you delete them. AdBack may use both session and persistent  cookies to customize your web experience and to analyze web traffic.<br /><br />
  AdBack uses cookies and web beacons in the delivery of  display advertisements to our website visitors and to our clients&rsquo; website  visitors on various sites across the internet. This is how the process works:<br /><br />
  You visit our client&rsquo;s website. Our web beacon fires and  drops a persistent cookie onto your browser. When you leave the client&rsquo;s  website and visit a second website, AdBack and/or its ad technology are able to  recognize that browser cookie and serve a display ad to you.<br /><br />
  These cookies do not store any PII, but they do record the  following information: the set of people cookied, websites visited, where and  when people viewed our ads, interactions (such as clicks) with an ad, and if a  purchase was made. This type of information can in no way be used to identify a  specific person or user of our service. This data will never be shared with  third parties or used to display ads for a third party without explicit written  permission from all parties.<br /><br />
  The NPII collected by AdBack in the aforementioned process  will be kept by AdBack indefinitely and will be securely maintained and  archived. AdBack does not link the NPII described here to any personally  identifiable information provided to us.<br /><br />
  We believe everyone should have control over which ads they  see, and we allow anyone to opt out from being served retargeted ads by or  through AdBack&rsquo;s service. If you use multiple browsers or devices, you will  need to opt out on each browser or device, and if you delete your cookies you  will need to opt out again.<br /><br />

  <br />
  <strong>THIRD-PARTY SHARING:</strong><br /><br />
  All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is  maintained in confidence by AdBack. There are instances, however, in which  personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared  with third parties, as described below.<br /><br />
  With respect to personally identifiable information provided  to AdBack, AdBack may, from time to time, provide information to certain  third-party vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative  services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related  to providing the AdBack service. Vendors and service providers are  contractually required to keep confidential the information received, and may  not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they perform on  our behalf.<br /><br />
  AdBack may, from time-to-time, send email marketing messages  on behalf of third-party advertisers. We do not endorse, nor are we responsible  for the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of each  of the third-party advertisers on behalf of whom we may send email marketing  messages. These third-party advertisers are independent third parties and are  not affiliated with us. Your personally identifiable information will not be  shared with third-party advertisers.&nbsp;<br /><br />
  Finally, AdBack may share information on individuals as it  deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government  and law enforcement officials.<br /><br />
  <strong>UNSUBSCRIBE/OPT-OUT:</strong> <br /><br />
  You may opt-out from the receipt of email marketing messages  from AdBack by clicking at the &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; link located at the  bottom of each email marketing message sent by us. You will then be directed to  the Website where you will be able to enter your email address and unsubscribe  from future email marketing messages.&nbsp; Or you can globally unsubscribe  your email address by clicking here: <strong><a href="http://yoursafeconsumer.com/optininfo.aspx">AdBack  Opt-Out</a>.</strong><br />

          <br />
          AdBack uses cookies and/or web beacons to provide our site  based retargeting service.

          <br />

          <br />
          <strong>Personally  Identifiable Information</strong><br />
          <br />
          If a client elects to provide AdBack with personally  identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us to have such data deleted  in its entirety at any time. Please note that if you choose to delete your  information completely you will no longer be able to utilize AdBack&rsquo;s services.  You may email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ad-back.net" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; ">customerservice@ad-back.net</a> or use one of the alternate  contact methods listed at the end of this policy to remove your contact  information from our database provided we have completed all your pending  transactions. Please note that information is never completely removed from our  history and disaster recovery archives.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>SECURITY:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          All personally identifiable information used by AdBack is  stored in a technically and physically secure environment. All personally  identifiable information is restricted. Only employees who need the information  to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. Employees  not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In  compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any  applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information  security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified  via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be  delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope  of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          AdBack takes security very seriously, and we take measures  to protect all of our data from unauthorized access, destruction or disclosure.  We employ reasonable security measures such as maintaining physical, electronic  and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state  regulations.<br />
          <br />
          Pages within AdBack that collect credit card information are  SSL encrypted to ensure a secure transaction.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>MINORS:</strong><br />
          <br />
          We do not knowingly send email marketing messages to minors  under the age of 18. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online  with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities  of their children.&nbsp; Children 18 and under are not eligible to use AdBack  services without the participation and supervision of a legal parent or  guardian. AdBack is not designed for children and does not provide privacy  measures to protect children. If you believe your child has provided AdBack  with personally identifiable data and you would like to have the data removed,  please contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ad-back.net" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none; ">customerservice@ad-back.net</a>. AdBack does not knowingly  target children under 13, and makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the  targeting of children under 13 does not occur across any campaigns run on  behalf of advertisers.<br />
          <br />
          Changes to AdBack&rsquo;s Corporate Structure<br />
          <br />
          If all or part of AdBack is sold, merged, or otherwise  transferred to another entity, the information gathered by AdBack may be  transferred as part of that transaction. AdBack will take reasonable measures  to ensure that such information is used in a manner consistent with the policy  under which it was collected.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>ACCEPTANCE:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
