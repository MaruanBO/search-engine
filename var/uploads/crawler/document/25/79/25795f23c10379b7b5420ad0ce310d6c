<span class="gray14"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span><br><br>
<span class="gray14"><strong>Payday Debt Management Programs - Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span><br><br>

<b>What is a payday loan?</b><br><br>
A payday loan, also called a paycheck advance or cash advance is a 
short-term loan that is intended to help a borrower with his/her 
expenses until their next paycheck. According to the Consumer Federation
 of America, typical payday loans vary between $100 and $1000 and 
average between two and four weeks. The average annual interest (APR) is
 estimated at 470%. Very often, the shorter the loan term the higher the
 interest.<br><br>
<b>How does a payday loan work?</b><br><br>
Payday borrowers give electronic access to their bank account for 
automatic withdrawal for the amount being borrowed including a finance 
charge. Lenders loan the borrower the amount in cash and hold the check 
until the borrower's next paycheck. At that time, borrowers can pay the 
loan off by paying the Principal and finance charge, or simply the 
finance charge and roll the loan over to another month.

Are payday loans bad?
Although payday lending has come under controversial scrutiny in the 
last couple years, the truth is that there are situations when a payday 
loan is very helpful. However, just as with any other loan, but perhaps 
even more prevalent with payday loans, borrowers must practice 
responsible lending.
<br><br>
<b>Who regulates payday lending?</b><br><br>
Although payday lending is largely regulated at the state level, in 
2006, Congress passed a regulatory law, namely The John Warner National 
Defense Authorization Act, capping the lending to military personnel at 
36%. The Defense Department labeled the payday lending institution 
"predatory". Some states, including DC and New Mexico have passed 
similar regulatory laws with maximum interest rates and Georgia banned 
payday lending entirely.
<br><br>
<b>What is internet payday lending?</b><br><br>
Internet payday lending is when a consumer or potential borrower fills 
out a form or online application and faxes it to the lender with the 
requisite information including bank account numbers and social security
 number, a copy of a personal check and/or bank statement. The payday 
loan is thereafter, directly deposited into the consumer's account and 
on the due date the finance charge is automatically withdrawn by the 
borrower.
<br><br>
<b>How much will payday loan consolidation help?</b><br><br>
While there is no way to estimate your savings, because each payday 
lender has unique circumstances with many contributing factors, Payday 
loan consolidation may reduce your monthly payments and ultimately 
eliminate your payday loan debt. You have nothing to lose besides 10 
minutes of your time. So let's walk through the application together and
 find out if we can help you get out of the payday loan debt cycle.
<br><br>
<b>How does Payday Loan Consolidation work?</b><br><br>
Our program is designed to get you out of debt as fast as possible. We 
work with you to determine a payment you can afford. What we do is 
eliminate interest in most cases, or in cases where lenders are properly
 established domestically with banks ("short term installment loans), 
reduce your interest.  Our team of negotiators will contact your lenders
 to set up an affordable repayment plan to eliminate your debt.
<br><br>
<b>Are you a reputable company?</b><br><br>
Yes, we are. Our processing center has been in business since 2005 and 
has an A-rating with the Better Business Bureau.  We serve thousands of 
clients and have a completion rate of greater than 85%.   
<br><br>
<b>Will my lenders work with you?</b><br><br>
We work with most payday lenders and/or their collection agencies. 
Although lenders are not required by law to work with us, most 
understand it is in everyone's best interest for us to work together to 
resolve your debts.   We have a 99% cooperation rate because lenders 
also have no legal recourse to pursue collection efforts.  This is why 
they resort to threats and intimidation tactics, but don't actually take
 legal action.  They have no authority to do so.  
<br><br>
<b>How much does the program cost?</b><br><br>
Your monthly payment depends on how much debt you have and they type of 
lender with which you have loans, specifically whether the lender is 
Licensed or Unlicensed, domestic or offshore and whether a loan was a 
domestic installment loan vs. a payday loan.   In most cases, the 
monthly payment is only about 25% or less of what you are currently 
paying in renewal fees if you have 4 or more outstanding loans.
<br><br>
<b>How long does the process take?</b><br><br>
Typically, our payday loan consolidation programs range from 10 to 18 
months in duration. It all depends on how much debt you have and what 
you can afford. With thousands of payday loan companies out there, exact
 results can be hard to predict, but we rely on our extensive experience
 to create a conservative estimate of program length for you at the time
 you enroll.  It is most important to pick a monthly payment that you 
can afford, since you don't want to default out of this program.
<br><br>
<b>Do you accept online and storefront loans?</b><br><br>
Yes, in most cases, we can accept EITHER storefront or online payday loans into our debt relief program.
If you have multiple outstanding payday loans, you owe it to yourself to schedule a free, no-hassle consultation today.

<b>*Court costs and filing fees additional.</b>  <br><br><br>
<b>Guaranteed Low Hourly Rate:</b><br><br>
Plan attorneys have contracted to never charge more than $125.00 per 
hour, or when appropriate, give members a 40% discount off their usual 
and customary hourly rate, which ever is greater for legal care that 
goes beyond the free and discounted services described above. 
<br><br><b>Retainers:</b><br><br>
In the case of extended legal care, plan attorneys may ask the member 
for a retainer.  Any retainer sought will be computed by multiplying the
 number of hours a plan attorney believes a case will take, by the 
appropriate discounted hourly plan rate. For instance; 10 hours x 
$125.00 = a retainer of $1,250.00.  Any unused portion of the retainer 
will be returned to the member.
<br><br><b>Contingency Fee Discounts:</b><br><br>
The contingency fee discount will be a 10% reduction of the state maximum rate or the attorney's usual rate, whichever is lower.<br><br>
*In many states, Attorney liability may require Plan Attorneys to obtain
 a retainer from the member prior to providing some of the free member 
benefits.
