Our many 'semi-lovely' stores sell merchandise of all descriptions and some beyond description. You'll find lots of famous brand name goods in every department, like housewares from Rubbermaid, Mirro, Ekco and Anchor Hocking. Toys and sporting goods from Igloo, Coleman and Mattel. Ollie's buyers scour the world looking for closeouts, overruns, package changes, manufacturer refurbs and irregulars. Much of the merchandise comes direct from the finest manufacturers in the country and abroad. For instance, if a manufacturer makes too much of an item, or changes their packaging - Ollie's will buy the discontinued or overstock items. So you will always find famous brand name products at Ollie's . . . but it could be last year's color or pattern that traditional retailers won't sell. Folks, everything you buy at Ollie's is covered by our 30-day No Hard Time Guarantee. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase - return it within 30 days for a full refund (with sales receipt).";i:3;s:4:"8820";}}
